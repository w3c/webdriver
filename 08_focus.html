  <h2>Running Without Window Focus</h2>
  <p>All browsers must comply with the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus">focus</a> section of
  the [[!HTML5]] spec. In particular, the requirement that the element within a top-level browsing
  context be independent of whether or not the top-level browsing context itself
  has system focus MUST be followed.</p>

  <p class="note">This requirement is put in place to allow efficient machine
  utilization when using the WebDriver API to control several browsers
  independently on the same desktop</p>
