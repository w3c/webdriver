# W3C WebDriver Specification

This repository contains the W3C specification
for the browser automation standard known as _WebDriver_.
The main repository is at https://github.com/w3c/webdriver.

## Generating the specification

The `webdriver-spec.html` is generated by executing::

    make

The numbers at the start of each file corresponds to sections in the
spec.

## Validation

To validate the specification you need to first set up a number of
dependencies on your system:

  * Selenium Python package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium)
    Available from PyPI as selenium.

  * linkchecker (https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/link-checker/)
    On Debian/Ubuntu this is available as the w3c-linkchecker package.

  * An implemenation of Java 1.6 or newer

  * curl (http://curl.haxx.se/)
    On Debian/Ubuntu this is available as the curl package.

All of these programs must be available on your PATH for validation to
succeed.
