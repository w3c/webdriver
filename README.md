# W3C WebDriver Specification

[![Validation Status](https://travis-ci.org/w3c/webdriver.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/w3c/webdriver)

This repository contains the ongoing work on the W3C specification
for the browser automation protocol known as _WebDriver_.
It is being developed by the [Browser Testing and Tools Working Group](http://www.w3.org/testing/browser/).

We highly recommend following the [editorâ€™s draft](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html)
as this more reflects reality than the [working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/).

Bugs can be filed against the [W3C bug tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?comment=&blocked=20860&short_desc=%5BWebDriver%20Spec%5D%3A%20&product=Browser%20Test%2FTools%20WG&component=WebDriver),
and pull requests should patch `webdriver-spec.html`.
