# W3C WebDriver Specification [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/w3c/webdriver.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/w3c/webdriver)

This repository contains the ongoing work on the W3C specification
for the browser automation protocol known as _WebDriver_.
It is being developed by the [Browser Testing and Tools Working Group](http://www.w3.org/testing/browser/).

The [working draft version of the spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) is automatically re-published each
time a change is committed to the [editor’s draft](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html). So the
content of the two versions is identical (they just have slightly different presentational “skinning“).

Bugs can be filed against the [W3C bug tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?comment=&blocked=20860&short_desc=%5BWebDriver%20Spec%5D%3A%20&product=Browser%20Test%2FTools%20WG&component=WebDriver),
and pull requests should patch `webdriver-spec.html`.
