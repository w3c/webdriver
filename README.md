WebDriver Standard
==================

[WebDriver] is a remote control interface that enables introspection
and control of user agents.  It provides a platform- and language-neutral
wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely
instruct the behavior of web browsers.

Provided is a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM
elements in web documents and to control the behavior of a user
agent. It is primarily intended to allow web authors to write tests
that automate a user agent from a separate controlling process, but
may also be used in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to
control a — possibly separate — browser.

The standard is authored by the W3C [Browser Testing- and Tools
Working Group], and has produced the following documents:

  * **Living Standard**: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/
  * **Candidate Recommendation** version 1: https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/
