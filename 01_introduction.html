<h3>Conformance</h3>

<p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative,
 as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
 Everything else in this specification is normative.

<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHOULD”,
 “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL”
 in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].
 The key word "OPTIONALLY" in the normative parts of this document
 is to be interpreted with the same normative meaning as “MAY” and “OPTIONAL”.

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms
 or specific steps may be implemented in any manner,
 so long as the end result is equivalent.

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>The terminology most used in this specification is from
 HTML, DOM, and CSS. [[!HTML]] [[!DOM4]] [[!CSS21]]

<p>In equations, all numbers are integers,
 subtraction is represented by “−”, and bitwise OR by “|”.
 The characters “(” and “)” are used to provide logical grouping in these contexts.

<p>This specification defines three broad conformance classes:

<dl>
 <dt><dfn>Local End</dfn>
 <dd>This represents the client side of the protocol,
  which is usually in the form of language-specific libraries
  providing an API on top of the WebDriver protocol.
  This specification does not place any restrictions on the details of those libraries
  above the level of the wire protocol.
  <!-- TODO: define the requirements on the local end somewhere -->

 <dt><dfn>Remote End</dfn>
 <dd>This is the server side of the protocol,
  which is usually implemented by a web browser or similar user agent.
  Defining the behaviour of the remote end in response to the WebDriver protocol
  forms the largest part of this specification.

 <dt><dfn>Intermediary Node</dfn>
 <dd>Intermediary nodes are those that act as proxies,
  implementing both the client and server sides of the protocol.
  Intermediary nodes must be black-box indistinguishable from a <a>remote end</a>
  from the point of view of <a>local end</a>
  and so are bound by the requirements on a <a>remote end</a> in terms of the wire protocol.
  However they are not expected to implement <a>commands</a> directly.
