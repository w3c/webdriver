<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API aims to provide a synchronous API that can be used for a variety of use cases, though
  it is primarily designed to support automated testing of web apps.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>This specification is intended for implementors of the WebDriver API. It is not intended as light bed
    time reading.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Relationship of WebDriver API and Existing Specifications</h3>
    <p>Where possible and appropriate, the WebDriver API references existing specifications. For example, the
    list of boolean attributes for elements is drawn from the
    <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html">HTML specification</a>. When references are made, this
    specification will link to the relevant sections.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Naming the Two Sides of the API</h3>

    <p>The WebDriver API can be thought of as a client/server process. However, implementation details can mean that this terminology becomes confusing. For this reason, the two sides of the API are called the "local" and the "remote" ends.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><dfn id="local-end">Local</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The user-facing API. <code><a href="#command-1">Command</a></code> objects are sent and <code><a href="#response">Response</a></code> objects are
      consumed by the local end of the WebDriver API. It can be thought of as
      being "local" to the user of the API.</dd>

      <dt><dfn id="remote-end">Remote</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The implementation of the user-facing API. <code><a href="#command-1">Command</a></code> objects are
      consumed and <code><a href="#response">Response</a></code> objects are sent by the remote end of the WebDriver
      API. The implementation of the remote end may be on a machine remote from
      the user of the local end.</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>There is no requirement that the local and remote ends be in different processes. The IDLs given in this specification SHOULD be used as the basis for any conforming local end implementation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Conformance Requirements</h3>

    <p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

    <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]]. The key word "OPTIONALLY" in the normative parts of this document is to be interpreted with the same normative meaning as "MAY" and "OPTIONAL".</p>

    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Conformance Classes</h3>

    <p>This specification defines three broad conformance classes:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><dfn>Local End</dfn>
      <dd>This represents the client side of the protocol, which is usually in the form of language-specific libraries providing an API on top of the WebDriver protocol. This specification does not place any restrictions on the details of those libraries above the level of the wire protocol. <!-- TODO: define the requirements on the local end somewhere -->
      <dt><dfn>Remote End</dfn>
      <dd>This is the server side of the protocol, which is usually implemented by a web browser or similar user agent. Defining the behaviour of the remote end in response to the WebDriver protocol forms the largest part of this specification.
      <dt><dfn>Intermediary Node</dfn>
      <dd>Intermediary nodes are those that act as proxies, implementing both the client and server sides of the protocol. Intermediary nodes must be black-box indistinguishable from <a>remot ends</a> from the point of view of <a>local end</a> and so are bound by the requirements on <a>remote ends</a> in terms of the wire protocol. However they are not expected to implement <a>commands</a> directly.
    </dl>

   <h3>Terminology</h3>

   <p>In equations, all numbers are integers,
    subtraction is represented by “−”, and bitwise OR by “|”. 
    The characters “(” and “)” are used to provide logical grouping in these contexts.

   <h3>Common Infrastructure</h3>

   <h4>Style Pixel Values</h4>

   <p>When asked to <dfn>normalize style pixel values to integer</dfn>
    for a value <var>s</var>:

   <ol>
    <li>Let <var>trimmed string</var> be a substring of <var>s</var>
     where the suffix "px" is removed.

    <li>Let <var>pixels</var> be the result of parsing
     <var>trimmed string</var> as an integer.

    <li>If <var>pixels</var> is not a valid integer or the previous
     operation did not succeed, return 0.

    <li>Return <var>pixels</var>.
   </ol>

   <p>When asked to <dfn>normalize style pixel values to floating
    point</dfn> for a value <var>s</var>:

   <ol>
    <li>Let <var>trimmed string</var> be a substring of <var>s</var>
     where the suffix "px" is removed.

    <li>Let <var>pixels</var> be the result of parsing
     <var>trimmed string</var> as a float.

    <li>If <var>pixels</var> is not a valid float
     or the previous operation did not succeed, return 0.0.

    <li>Round off <var>pixels</var> using <code>ceil</code>
     so that it has no more than four decimals.

    <li>Return <var>pixels</var>.
   </ol>

   <p class=note>These operations are almost equivalent to calling
    <code><a href=http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.1.2.2>parseInt</a></code>
    and <code><a href=http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.1.2.3>parseFloat</a></code>
    from [[!ECMA-262]] with the exception that non-valid integer
    or float return values are returned as 0 or 0.0.
