  <h2>Handling non-HTML Content</h2>
  <p>If the browser creates a Document object to display non-HTML content,
  the Document MUST be treated in the same manner as HTML. If a Document Object is not
  created then how a non-HTML document is handled SHOULD be non-normative</p>

    <h2>XML</h2>
    <p>This section describes XML documents as described in [[XML10]]. For XHTML documents the remote end should treat them as HTML documents
    and not have the caveats, below, applied.</p>
      <p>Since Browsers create a Document object for XML pages it is expected that we can interogate
      them as a normal HTML document however the following differences should be noted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visibility Checks MAY be skipped since XML nodes can not be hidden and <code>isDisplayed</code> MUST return true<li>
        <li>Getting computed styles of elements MUST return an empty string</li>
        <li>Position and Size of element MUST return null for elements in the map returned</li>
        <li>Attempts to clear the node MUST return an <code><a href='#status-unsupported-operation'>unsupported operation</a></code> </li>
        <li>Attempts to send keys to a node MUST return an exception <code><a href='#status-unsupported-operation'>unsupported operation</a></code></li>
        <li><code>isEnabled</code> MUST return false</li>
        <li><code>isSelected</code> MUST return false</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <p>This section described SVG documents in a browser as described by [[SVG2]].
    Since browsers create a Document tree for SVG documents it is expected that WebDriver
    can interrogate the Document as a normal HTML document.

    <h2>Working with Accessibility APIs</h2>

    <p>Many accessibility APIs represent the UI as a series of nested nodes. It is possible to map these nodes to <code>WebElement</code> instances. In order to function properly, it is likely that additional element locating strategies will be required.</p>

    <p class="note">This is one way in which it might be possible to test mobile applications that marry a native wrapper around a series of HTML views.</p>
