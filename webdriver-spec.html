<section id='abstract'>
<p>This specification defines the WebDriver API, a platform-and language-neutral interface that allows programs or scripts to introspect into, and control the behaviour of, a web browser. The WebDriver API is primarily intended to allow developers to write tests that automate a browser from a separate controlling process, but may also be implemented in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a (separate?) browser.</p>

<p>The WebDriver API is defined by a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements on a page, and to control the behaviour of the containing browser.</p>

<p>This specification also includes a non-normative reference serialisation (to JSON) of the interface's invocations and responses that may be useful for browser vendors.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API aims to provide a synchronous API that can be used for a variety of use cases, though
  it is primarily designed to support automated testing of web apps.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>This specification is intended for implementors of the WebDriver API. It is not intended as light bed
    time reading.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Relationship of WebDriver API and Existing Specifications</h3>
    <p>Where possible and appropriate, the WebDriver API references existing specifications. For example, the
    list of boolean attributes for elements is drawn from the 
    <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html">HTML5 specification</a>. When references are made, this
    specification will link to the relevant sections.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Naming the Two Sides of the API</h3>
    
    <p>The WebDriver API can be thought of as a client/server process. However, implementation details can mean that this terminology becomes confusing. For this reason, the two sides of the API are called the "local" and the "remote" ends.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Local</dt>
      <dd>The user-facing API. Command objects are sent and Response objects are consumed by the local end of the WebDriver API.</dd>
      
      <dt>Remote</dt>
      <dd>The implementation of the user-facing API. Command objects are consumed and Response objects are sent by the remote end of the WebDriver API.</dd>
      
    </dl>
    
    <p>There is no requirement that the local and remote ends be in different processes.</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Commands and Responses</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API is designed to be used both in-process and out-of-process. The IDL listed in Appendix
  XXXX SHOULD be used as the basis for the user-facing API. When used out-of-process, the WebDriver API
  defines command/repsonse objects that MUST be used. How these are encoded and transmitted between the browser being
  automated and the user of the API is left undefined, but a non-normative implementation of this as JSON over HTTP is
  given in appendix XXXX.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Command</h3>
    <p>A command represents a call to the remote end of the WebDriver API.</p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Command">
      <dt>attribute string sessionId</dt>
      <dd>A reference to the session to which this command is associated.</dd>
      <dt>attribute string name</dt>
      <dd>The name of the command to execute</dd>
      <!-- TODO: This should be a Dictionary or Map, not an object -->
      <dt>attribute object parameters</dt>
      <dd>A map of the named parameters to an object representing its value.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Response</h3>
    <p>A response represents the value returned from remote end of the WebDriver API.</p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Response">
      <dt>readonly attribute string sessionId</dt>
      <dd>A reference to the session to which this command is associated.</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute integer status</dt>
      <dd>The status code representing the success or failure of the method. Anything other than 0 indicates a failure
      of some kind</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute object value</dt>
      <dd>The return value of the method call. It's type is determined by the <code>Command</code> that has been executed. In the specification, each command definition will make clear what the expected return type is.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Processing Additional Fields on Commands and Responses</h3>
    
    <p>Any Command or Response MAY contain additional fields than those listed above. These fields MUST be maintained, unaltered by any intermediate processing nodes. There is no requirement to maintain the ordering of fields.</p>
    
    <div class="note">
      <p>This requirement exists to allow for extension of the protocol, and to allow implementors to decorate Commands and Responses with additional information, perhaps giving context to a series of messages. or providing security information.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Error Codes</h3>
    <p>The WebDriver API indicates the success or failure of a command invocation via a status code on the 
    <code>Response</code>object. The following values are used and have the following meanings.</p>
    <!-- TODO: These values are derived from existing common usage. Do they need to be reconsidered? -->

  <h2>Browser Capabilities</h2>
  <p>Different browsers support different levels of various specifications. For example, some support SVG or the CSS
  Selector API, but only browsers that implement HTML5 will support LocalStorage. The WebDriver API provides
  a mechanism to query the supported capabilities of a browser. Each broad area of functionality
  within the WebDriver API has an associated capability string. Whether a particular capability MUST or MAY
  be supported --- as well as fallback mechanisms for handling those cases where a capability is not supported --- is
  discussed where the capability string is defined.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Capabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface Capabilities">
    <dt>readonly attribute object capabilities</dt>
    <dd>The underlying collection of capabilities, represented as a dictionary mapping strings to values which may be
    of type boolean, numerical or string.</dd>
    <dt>boolean has(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Queries the underlying <code>capabilities</code> to see whether the
    value is set. This will return true if the capabilities contain a key with
    the given <code>capabilityName</code> and the value of that key is defined.
    If the value is a boolean, this function will return that boolean value. If
    the value is "null", an empty string or a 0 then this method will return
    false.</dd>
    <dt>object get(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Get the value of the key matching capabilityName in the underlying<code>capabilities</code>or <code>null</code>if no value is defined.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>A <code>Capabilities</code> instance MUST be immutable. If a mutable <code>Capabilities</code> instance is required, then the <code>MutableCapabilities</code> MUST be used instead.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>MutableCapabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface MutableCapabilities : Capabilities">
    <dt>void set(string capabilityName, object value)</dt>
    <dd>Set the value of the given <code>capabilityName</code>to the given <code>value</code>. If the value is not a boolean, numerical type or a string, a <code>WebDriverException</code>should be thrown.</dd>
  </dl>
</section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Sessions</h2>
  <p>Non-normative summary: A session is equivalent to a single instantiation of a particular browser, including all
  child windows. The WebDriver API gives each session a UUID stored as a string that can be used to differentiate one
  session from another, allowing multiple browsers to be controlled on the same machine if needed, and allowing
  sessions to be routed via a multiplexer. This ID is sent with every 
  <code>Command</code>and returned with every 
  <code>Response</code>and is stored on the 
  <code>sessionId</code>field.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Creating a Session</h3>
    <p>The process for successfully creating a session follows.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The local end creates a new Capabilities or MutableCapabilities instance describing the desired capabilities
      for the session. The Capabilities object MAY be empty, but MUST be defined.</li>
      <li>The local end creates a new Command with the "name" being "newSession" and the "parameters" containing an
      entry named "desiredCapabilities" with the value set to the Capabilities instance from the previous step. The
      "sessionId" fields SHOULD be left empty.</li>
      <li>The Command is serialized and transmitted to the remote end.</li>
      <li>The remote end examines the Capabilities, and creates a new session matching as many of the Capabilities as
      possible. How the new session is created depends on the implementation of this specification. In the case of a
      browser automation framework, it is expected that a new instance of the browser is started if possible.</li>
      <li>The session must be assigned a UUID which MUST be unique for each session (by definition). Generating the UUID
      MAY occur before the session is created. If the Command object had the "sessionId" field set, this MAY be
      discarded in favour of the freshly generated UUID. Because of this, it is
      recommended that UUID generation be done on the remote end.</li>
      <li>The remote end create a new Response object. 
      <ul>
        <li>The "sessionId" field is assigned the UUID associated with this session.</li>
        <li>The session is described by filling a Capabilities instance with keys matching the parts of this
        specification that can be fulfilled. This is assigned to the "value" field of the Response. This fields MUST
        be filled</li>
        <li>The "status" field is set to "0"</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>The Response is transmitted or returned back to the local end.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There is no requirement for the local end to validate that some or all of the fields sent on the Capabilities
    associated with the Command match those returned in the Response.</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Capability Names</h3>
      <p>The following keys are to be used in the Capabilities instances.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>browserName</dt>
        <dd>The name of the desired browser as a string</dd>
        <dt>browserVersion</dt>
        <dd>The version number of the browser, given as a string</dd>
        <dt>platform</dt>
        <dd>The OS that the browser is running on, matching any of the platform names given below.</dd>
        <dt>platformVersion</dt>
        <dd>The version of the OS that the browser is running on as a string.</dd>
      </dl>

      <section>
        <h3>Platform Names</h3>
        <p>These SHOULD be named in the style of enums in C-like languages.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ANDROID</li>
          <li>IOS</li>
          <li>LINUX</li>
          <li>MAC</li>
          <li>UNIX</li>
          <li>WINDOWS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition "ANY" may be used to indicate the underlying OS is either unknown or does not matter.
        Implementors MAY add additional platform names.</p>

        <!-- TODO: Add section on comparing platforms -->

      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Error Handling</h3>
      <p>The following status codes MUST be returned by the "newSession" command. Please consult the table in the
      "commands" section for numerical values:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Success</dt>
        <dd>The session was successfully created. The "value" field of the Response MUST contain a Capabilities object
        describing the session</dd>
        <dt>Timeout</dt>
        <dd>The new session could not be created within the time allowed for command execution on the remote end. This
        time MAY be infinite. The "value" field of the Response SHOULD contain a string explaining that a timeout has
        occurred, but it MAY be left empty or filled with the empty string.</dd>
        <dt>UnknownError</dt>
        <dd>An unhandled error of some sort has occurred. The "value" field of the Response SHOULD contain a more detailed
        description of the error.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Remote End Matching of Capabilities</h3>
      <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
      <p>The suggested order for comparing keys in the Capabilities instance when creating a session is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>browserName</li>
        <li>browserVersion</li>
        <li>platform</li>
        <li>platformVersion</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For all comparisons, if the key is missing (as determined by a call to Capability.has()), that particular criteria shall not factor into the
      comparison.</p>
    </section>

<h2>Navigation</h2>
  
<p>Almost all usages of the WebDriver API begin by navigating to a particular URL. This section not only describes the commands used for navigation, but also describes when commands must be processed.</p>

<p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support navigating between different HTTP domains.</p>

<section>
<a name="page-load-strategies"><h2>Page Load Strategies</h2></a>

<dl>
  <dt>conservative</dt>
  <dd>The remote end MUST wait until all frames and iframes in the window currently be used to process commands
  that contain an HTML document are at "document.readyState == 'complete'" and
  there are no outstanding HTTP requests, other than those caused by
  XMLHttpRequests. If a frame or iframe does not contain an HTML document, the remote
  end SHOULD wait until all HTTP traffic to that frame is complete.</dd>

  <dt>normal</dt>
  <dd>The remote ends MUST wait until the frame currently handling commands reaches
  "document.readyState == 'complete'" or there are no more outstanding
  network requests other than XMLHttpRequests.</dd>

  <dt>eager</dt>
  <dd>The remote end MUST wait until the frame currently handling commands reaches
  "document.readyState == 'interactive' || document.readyState ==
  'complete'" or there are no more outstanding network requests.</dd>
  
  <dt>none</dt>
  <dd>The remote end does not do any checks to see if a page load is currently active.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support the <code>normal</code> and <code>eager</code> modes and SHOULD support the <code>conservative</code> and <code>none</code> modes. If no page loading strategy is chosen, then <code>normal</code> MUST be the default.</p>

<p>The "get" command is used to cause the browser under test to navigate to a new location, and is named after the HTTP verb. From a user's point of view, this is as if they have entered the "url" into the URL bar. When the command returns is based on the <a href="#page-load-strategies">page load strategy</a> that the user has selected with the following exceptions when the strategy is not "none":

<ul>
    <li>HTTP redirects MUST be automatically followed without first returning control to the user.</li>
    <li>Control MUST return to the user on pages with an HTML META tags that would cause a refresh only if the timeout is greater than 1 second.</li>
    <li>Control MUST be returned to the user if any modal dialog box, such as those opened by on <code>window.onbeforeunload</code> or <code>window.alert</code>, is opened at any point.</li>
    <li>Control MUST be returned to the user if user credentials are requested by the browser. That is, if BASIC, DIGEST, NTLM or similar authentication is required. This does not include FORM-based authentication.</li>

<p>WebDriver implementations MUST support users accessing sites served via HTTPS. Access to  those sites using self-signed certificates, and where the certificate does not match the serving domain MUST be the same as if the HTTPS was configured properly.</p>

<p class="note">The reason for this is that WebDriver instances are often used for testing. It's a sorry fact that many QA and testers are asked to verify that apps work on sites that have insecure HTTPS configurations</p>
</section>

<p>The exception to requirement is if the <code>Capabilities</code> used to initialize has the WebDriver session had the capability <code>secureSsl</code> set to true. In this case, implementations MAY chose to make accessing a site with bad HTTPS configurations cause a <code>WebDriverException</code> to be thrown. If this is the case, the <code>Capabilities</code> describing the session MUST also set the <code>secureSsl</code> capability to "true".

<h2>Controlling Windows</h2>

<section>
	<h2>Defining "window" and "frame"</h2>
	
	<p>Within this specification, a window equates to anything that would be referred to as "window.top" in javascript. Put another way, within this spec browser tabs are counted as separate windows.</p>

	<p><strong>TODO: define "frame"</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Window Handles</h2>
	
	<p>Each window has a "window handle" associated with it. This is an opaque string which is unique to the window. The suggested implementation is as a UUID. The "getWindowHandle" command can be used to obtain the window handle for the window that commands are currently acting upon:</p>
	
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>Command Name</td>
			<td>getWindowHandle</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Parameters</td>
			<td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>Return Value</td>
		    <td>string</td>
		</tr>

	<h2>Iterating Over Windows</h2>

		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>Return Value</td>
		    <td>Array.&lt;string&gt;</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>This array of returned strings MUST contain a handle for every window associated with the browser session and no others. In addition, at the time of collecting the window handles the javascript expression "window.top.closed" MUST evaluate to false.</p>
	    
	<p>The ordering of the keys is not defined, but SHOULD be determined by iterating over each top level browser window and returning the tabs within that window before iterating over the tabs of the next top level browser window. For example, in the diagram below, the window handles should be returned as the handles for: win1tab1, win1tab2, win2.</p>
	
	<img src="example_windows.png" alt="Two top level windows. The first window has two tabs, lablled win1tab1 and win1tab2. The second window has only one tab labelled win2"/>

    	</tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>The close command closes the window that commands are currently being sent to. If this means that a call to get the list of window handles returns an empty list, then this close command MUST be the equivalent of calling "quit". In all other cases, control MUST be returned to the calling process once the window has been closed or an alert is displayed by the closing window.</p>
    
    <p>Once the window has closed, future commands MUST return an error NoSuchWindowException until a new window is selected for receiving commands.</p>

    		</td>
    	</tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>Both of these commands accept the window handles returned by "getWindowHandles" and "getWindowHandle". In addition, the window handle may be "current", in which case the window that commands are currently being handled by MUST be acted upon.</p>
    
    <p>The "width" and "height" values refer to the "window.outerheight" and "window.outerwidth" properties. For those browsers that do not support these properties, these represent the height and width of the whole browser window including window chrome and window resizing borders/handles.</p>

    <h2>Scaling the Content of Windows</h2>
    
    <p>TODO</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Where Commands Are Handled</h2>
  
<p>Web applications can be composed of multiple windows and/or frames. For a normal user, the context in which an operation is performed is obvious: it's the window or frame that currently has OS focus and which has just received user input. The WebDriver API does not follow this convention. There is an expectation that many browsers using the WebDriver API may be used at the same time on the same machine. This section describes how WebDriver tracks which window or frame is currently the context in which commands are being executed.</p>
    
<section>
<h2>Default Content</h2>

<p>WebDriver's <def="default_content">default context</def> is the equivalent of <code>window._top</code>.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Switching Windows</h2>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Command Name</td>
		<td>switchToWindow</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Parameters</td>
		<td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.<br/>
		    "name" {string} The identifier used for a window.</td>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Return Value</td>
	    <td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Throws</td>
	    <td>NoSuchWindowException if no matching window can be found</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The "switchToWindow" command is used to select which window should currently be accepting commands. In order to determine which window should be used for accepting commands, the "switchToWindow" command will iterate over all windows. For each window, the following will be compared --- in this order --- with the "name" parameter:
    
    <ol>
        <li>A window handle, obtained from "getWindowHandles" or "getWindowHandle".</li>
        <li>The window name, as defined when the window was opened (the value of "window.name")</li>
        <li>The "id" attribute of the window.</li>
    </ol>

If no windows match, then a "NoSuchWindowException" MUST be thrown, otherwise the "default content" of the first window to match will be selected for accepting commands.</p>

<p>When a new browser session is started by WebDriver and only a single window is present then the default content of that window becomes the "current" window. When more than one window is opened, the "current" window is undefined. Any commands that are executed at this point that require a window MUST throw an exception (<strong>TODO: Which exception? Ideally the same as if a window had just been closed</strong>). The correct way for a user to recover from this situation is to obtain the list of window handles and to "switch to" one of these.</p>

<h2>Switching Frames</h2>

	    <td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Throws</td>
	    <td>NoSuchFrameException if no matching frame can be found</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The "switchToFrame" command is used to select which frame within a window should be used for handling future commands. All frame switching is taken from the current context from which commands are currently being handled. The "id" parameter can be one of a string, number of an element. WebDriver implementations MUST determine which frame to select using the following algorithm:

<ol>
    <li>If the "id" is a number the current context is set to the equivalent of the JS expression "window.frames[n]" where "n" is the number and "window" is the DOM window represented by the current context.</li>
    <li>If the "id" is a string:
        <ol>
            <li>If the value is "_top", the current context is set to the equivalent of "window._top".</li>
            <li>If the JS expression "window.frames[id]" evaluated in the current context returns a window, where "id" is the value of the the "id" parameter, the current context is set to that.</li>
            <li>Otherwise for each value of "window.frames" (referred to as "window"):
                <ol>
                    <li>If "window" has a "name" property or attribute equal to the "id" parameter, this becomes the current context.</li>
                    <li>If "window" has an "id" property or attribute equal to the "id" parameter, this becomes the current context.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If the "id" represents a WebElement, and the corresponding DOM element represents a FRAME or an IFRAME, and the WebElement is part of the current context, the "window" property of that DOM element becomes the current context.</li>
</ol>

In all cases if no match is made a "NoSuchFrameException" MUST be thrown.</p>

  <h2>Running Without Window Focus</h2>
  <p>All browsers must comply with the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus">focus</a> section of
  the [[!HTML5]] spec. In particular, the requirement that the element within a top-level browsing
  context be independent of whether or not the top-level browsing context itself
  has system focus MUST be followed.</p>

  <p class="note">This requirement is put in place to allow efficient machine
  utilization when using the WebDriver API to control several browsers
  independently on the same desktop</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p>One of the key abstractions of the WebDriver API is the 
  <code>WebElement</code> interface. Each instance of this interface represents an 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#ID-745549614">Element</a>as defined in the
  [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-CORE]] specification. Because the WebDriver API is designed to allow users to interact with apps as if
  they were actual users, the capabilities offered by the 
  <code>WebElement</code> interface are somewhat different from those offered by the DOM Element interface.</p>

  <p>Each WebElement instance must have an ID, which is distinct from the value
  of the DOM Element's "id" property. The ID for every WebElement representing the same
  underlying DOM Element must be the same. The IDs used to refer to different
  underlying DOM Elements must be unique.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p>This requirement around WebElement IDs allows for efficient equality
    checks when the WebDriver API is being used out of process.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This section of the specification covers finding elements. Later sections deal with querying and interacting with
  these located elements. The primary interface used by the WebDriver API for locating elements is the 
  <code>SearchContext</code>.</p>
  <section>
    <h2>Lists of WebElements</h2>
    
    <p>The primary grouping of <code>WebElement</code> instances is an <code>array</code> of <code>WebElement</code> instances</p>
    
    <p>A reference to an WebElement is obtained via a SearchContext. The key
    interfaces are:</p>

      <p>The HTML5 specification ([[!HTML5]]) states that <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/elements.html#the-id-attribute">element IDs must be unique within their home subtree</a>. Sadly, this uniqueness requirement is not always met. Consequently, this strategy is equally valid for finding a single element, or groups of elements. In the case of finding a single WebElement, this MUST be functionally identical to a call to "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#ID-getElBId">document.getElementById()</a>" from the Web DOM Core specification ([[!DOM-LEVEL-3-CORE]]). When finding multiple elements, this is equivalent to an CSS query of "<tt>#value</tt>" where "value" is the ID being searched for with all "'" characters being properly escaped..</p>

    <h2>Reading Attributes and Properties</h2>

<p>Although the [[!HTML5]] spec is very clear about the difference between the properties and attributes of a DOM element, users are frequently confused between the two. Because of this, the WebDriver API offers a single command ("getElementAttribute") which covers the case of returning both the value of a DOM element's property or attribute. If a user wishes to refer specifically to an attribute or a property, they should evaluate Javascript in order to be unambiguous.</p>

<p>In order to implement the "getElementAttribute" command, a series of sub functions are needed. These are detailed below.</p>

<section>
<h2>Reading an Attribute</h2>
    
<p>Reading an attribute is equivalent to calling the Javascript "getAttribute" function on an element, with the following exceptions:
<ul>
    <li>The "style" attribute MUST return the same value as if the "style" property was requested (see below).</li>
    <li>If the attribute represents a boolean and the attribute name is listed below the null value MUST be returned if the attribute is false, otherwise the string 'true' MUST be returned.</li>
    <li>If the attribute name represents a boolean and the attribute is not listed below, the null value SHOULD be returned if the attribute is false, otherwise the string 'true' SHOULD be returned.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The following are considered boolean attributes:
<ul>
   <li>async</li>
    <li>autofocus</li>
    <li>autoplay</li>
    <li>checked</li>
    <li>compact</li>
    <li>complete</li>
    <li>controls</li>
    <li>declare</li>
    <li>defaultchecked</li>
    <li>defaultselected</li>
    <li>defer</li>
    <li>disabled</li>
    <li>draggable</li>
    <li>ended</li>
    <li>formnovalidate</li>
    <li>hidden</li>
    <li>indeterminate</li>
    <li>iscontenteditable</li>
    <li>ismap</li>
    <li>itemscope</li>
    <li>loop</li>

</section>

<section>
    <h2>Reading a Property</h2>

<p>A DOM element property may be read using the equivalent of the Javascript "return element['propertyName']" with the null value being returned when there is no match. The following exceptions MUST be made:
        
    <ul>
        <li>For a property that is marked as boolean in [[!HTML5]] the boolean value "true" or "false" MUST be returned. If a document is using HTML5, then the section on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/Overview.html#boolean-attributes">boolean attributes</a> from the [[!HTML5]] spec MUST be followed. If the document is using a prior version of HTML, then "false" is returned iff the value of the property is equal to undefined.</li>
        <li>If the element is an OPTION element and the property name is "value" and there is no "value" attribute, then the text content of the OPTION element MUST be returned, in accordance with [[!HTML401]] spec, specifically the section on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#adef-value-OPTION">pre-selected options</a>. The text content MUST be the result of calling the "getElementText" command on the OPTION element.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
    
<p>If no property matches and the desired property name is in the table below, a WebDriver implementation MUST return the result of getting the aliased property.</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Original property name</th>
            <th>Aliased property name</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>class</td>
            <td>className</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>readonly</td>
            <td>readOnly</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

<p class="note">These aliases provide the commonly used names for element properties.</p>

<section>
<h2>The "style" Property</h2>

<p>The "style" property MUST be <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#serialize-a-css-rule">serialized as defined</a> in the [[!CSSOM]] spec. Notably, css property names MUST be cased the same as specified in in section 6.5.1 of the [[!CSSOM]] spec.</p>

<p>Consequently, it SHOULD be equivalent to obtaining the "cssText" property, with the additional constraint that the same value MUST be returned after a round trip through "executeScript". That is, the following pseudo-code MUST be true (where "driver" is a WebDriver instance, and "element" is a WebElement):</p>

<pre class="code">
var style = element.getAttribute('style');
driver.executeScript('arguments[0].style = arguments[1]', element, style);
var recovered = element.getAttribute('style');
assertEquals(style, recovered);

<a name="selectable"><h2>Determining Whether a WebElement Is Selected</h2></a>
    
<p>WebDriver determines whether a WebElement is selected using the following algorithm:

<ol>
    <li><a href="is_selectable"></a>If the item is not "selectable", the WebElement is not selected. A selectable element is either an OPTION element or an INPUT element of type "checkbox" or "radio".</li> 
    <li>If the WebElement represents an INPUT element, call the "getProperty" method described above looking for the "checked" property. This indicates whether the element is selected.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, call the "getProperty" method described above looking for the "selected" property. This indicates whether the element is selected.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The "getElementAttribute" Command</h2>

		<td>Parameters</td>
		<td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.<br/>

<p>The "getElementAttribute" command depends on the functions described above. The algorithm to use MUST be:

<ol>
    <li>Examine the combination of WebElement tag name and the attribute name to determine whether the return value is expected to be a URL.</li>
    <li>If the combination is one that expects a URL:
        <ol>
            <li>Get the named attribute using the algorithm described above.</li>
            <li>If there is a value, return the named property using the algorithm described above.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, return null.
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If the named attribute case insensitively matches "selected" or "checked" and the WebElement is selectable (as detailed in <a href="#is_selectable">the first bullet point of determining whether a WebElement is selected</a>), get the value determined by that algorithm. Return the string "true" if the result is true, or the null value if false.</li>
    <li>Get the value of the named property using the algorithm above.</li>
    <li>If the returned value is defined, not null and not an object, return the value coerced into a string.</li>
    <li>Get the value of the named attribute using the algorithm above.</li>
    <li>If the value is defined and not null, return the value coerced into a string.</li>
    <li>Otherwise return null.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The following combination of WebElement tag names and values for "name" are considered to return a URL value:

   <h2>Rendering Text</h2>
   <p>All WebDriver implementations must support getting the <a href="#visibility">visible</a> text of a WebElement, with excess whitespace compressed.</p>
   
<p>The following definitions are used in this section:
    <dl>
        <dt><a name="text.whitespace">Whitespace</a></dt>
        <dd>Any text that matches the ECMAScript regular expression class <code>\s</code>.
        
        <dt><a name="text.whitespace-nbsp">Whitespace excluding non-breaking spaces</a></dt>
        <dd>Any text that matches the ECMAScript regular expression <code>[^\S\xa0]</code>
            
        <dt><a name="text.blocklevel">Block level element</a></dt>
        <dd>A block-level element is one which is not a table cell, and whose effective CSS display style is not in the set ['inline', 'inline-block', 'inline-table', 'none', 'table-cell', 'table-column', 'table-column-group']</dd>
        
        <dt><a name="text.horizontal">Horizontal whitespace characters</a></dt>
        <dd>Horizontal whitespace characters are defined by the ECMAScript regular expression <code>[\x20\t\u2028\u2029]</code>.</dd>
    </dl>
</p>

<p>The expected return value is roughly what a text-only browser such as Lynx would display. The algorithm for determining this text is as follows:</p>

<p>Let <code>lines</code> equal an empty array. Then:
<ol>  
    <li><a name="text.1">For</a> each <code>child</code> of node, at time of execution, in order:
        <ol>
            <li>Get whitespace, text-transform, and then, if <code>child</code> is:
                <ul>
                    <li>a node which is not <a href="#visibility">visible</a>, do nothing</li>
                    <li>a [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-CORE]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#ID-1312295772">text node</a> let <code>text</code> equal the <code>nodeValue</code> property of <code>child</code>. Then:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Remove any zero-width spaces (\u200b), form feeds (\f) or vertical tab feeds (\v) from <code>text</code>.</li>
                            <li>Canonicalize any recognized single newline sequence in <code>text</code> to a single newline (greedily matching <code>(\r\n|\r|\n)</code> to a single \n)</li>
                            <li>If the parent's effective CSS whitespace style is 'normal' or 'nowrap' replace each newline (\n) in <code>text</code> with a single space character (\x20). If the parent's effective CSS whitespace style is 'pre' or 'pre-wrap' replace each <a href="#text.horizontal">horizontal whitespace character</a> with a non-breaking space character (\xa0). Otherwise replace each sequence of <a href="#text.horizontal">horizontal whitespace characters</a> except non-breaking spaces (\xa0) with a single space character</li>
                            <li>Apply the parent's effective CSS text-transform style as per the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/text.html#propdef-text-transform">CSS2 specification</a> ([[!CSS2]])</li>
                            <li>If <code>last(lines)</code> ends with a space character and <code>text</code> starts with a space character, trim the first character of <code>text</code>.</li>
                            <li>Append <code>text</code> to <code>last(lines)</code> in-place</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>an element which is <a href="#visibility">visible</a>. If the element is a:
                        <ul>
                            <li>BR element: Push '' to <code>lines</code> and continue</li>

                        </ul>
                    And then recurse depth-first to <a href="text.1">step 1</a> with <code>child</code> set to the current element</li>
                    <li>If element is a TD element, or the effective CSS display style is 'table-cell', and last(lines) is not '', and <code>last(lines)</code> does not end with whitespace append a single space character to <code>last(lines)</code> [Note: Most innerText implementations append a \t here]</li>
                    <li>If element is a block-level element: push '' to <cpde>lines</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>For each line in <code>lines</code> trim any leading and trailing whitespace excluding <a href="text.whitespace-nbsp">non-breaking space characters</a>.</li>
    <li>Let <code>s</code> be <code>lines.join('\n')</code></li>
    <li>Trim any leading and trailing <a href="text.whitespace-nbsp">whitespace excluding non-breaking space characters</a> from <code>s</code>.</li>
    <li>Replace any non-breaking spaces (\xa0) with spaces (\x20) in <code>s</code>.</li>

  <h2>User Input</h2>
    <p>There are two ways to interact with a elements: Directly or indirectly.
    Direct interaction with elements is sending interaction commands directly to
    an element. In this kind of interaction, the implementation of this
    specification should take additional steps to ensure the interaction could
    happen as the user intended (for example, by scrolling the element into the
    viewport). Indirect interaction is more versatile by not
    tying a user-interaction to an element. Instead, these interactions are
    based on mouse position and the currently active element.</p>
    <section>
    <h2>Interaction directly with elements</h2>
    <section>
    <h2>Interactable elements</h2>
    <p>A common pre-requirement for all user-input actions is interactability of
    the element. The following conditions must be met for the element to be
    considered interactable:
    <ul>
      <li>The element SHOULD be visible, as defined in section 10.1.</li>
      <li>The element SHOULD be enabled:
      <ul>
        <li>The element does not support the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-disabled">disabled</a> attribute (according to the [[!HTML401]] spec).</li>
        </li>
        <p>OR</p>
        <li>The element supports the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-disabled">disabled</a> attribute but it is not present, AND</li>
        <li>If the element is an OPTION or OPTGROUP, it's parent element is
        enabled.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Clicking</h2>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface WebElement">
      <dt>void click()</dt>
      <dd>Clicks in the middle of the <code>WebElement</code> instance. The
      middle of the element is defined as the middle of the box returned by
      calling <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#the-getclientrects-and-getboundingclientrect-methods">getBoundingClientRect</a> on the underlying DOM Element, according to the [[!CSSOM-VIEW]] spec. If the element is outside the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#viewport">viewport</a> (according to the [[!CSS2]] spec), the implementation should bring the element into view first. The implementation MAY invoke scrollIntoView on the underlying DOM Element. The element SHOULD be visible, as defined in section 10.1.</dd>
    </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Typing keys</h2>
    <p>A pre-requirement for keys-based interaction with an element is that it is
    editable. The following conditions must be met for the element to be
    considered editable:
    <ul>
      <li>The "readOnly" property MUST NOT be set on the element and one of the
      following holds:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The element is a TEXTAREA element</li>
        <li>The element is an INPUT element and the element's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-input-element.html">control type</a> is a textual
        field, as defined in the [[!HTML5]] spec.</li>
        <li>The element is considered editable based on the the "contentEditable" attribute set, as defined in the [[!HTML5]] spec.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Prior to any keyboard interaction, the element SHOULD be focused if it
    does not currently have the focus. This is the case if one of the following
    holds:
    <ul>
      <li>The element is not <code>document.activeElement</code></li>
      <li>The owner document of the element to be interacted with is not the
      focused document.</li>
    </ul>
    In case focusing is needed, the implementation MAY call
    <code>document.activeElement.blur()</code>, then invoke <code>focus()</code>
    on the element to be interacted with.
    </p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface WebElement">
      <dt>void clear()</dt>
      <dd>For editable elements, clear the value of the element. If the element is not the currently focused one, it is first given the focus.</dd>
      <dt>void sendKeys(string keysToSend)</dt>
      <dd>For editable elements, sends a sequence of keyboard events representing the keys in the keysToSend parameter. If the element already contains text, the cursor is positioned at the end of the text (unless the element was already focused - in which case, the position of the cursor is not changed). After the call to this method, the cursor will be positioned at the end of the typed text sequence. There are four different types of keys that are emulated:
      <ul>
        <li>Character literals - lower-case symbols.</li>
        <li>Uppercase letters and symbols requiring the SHIFT key for typing.</li>
        <li>Modifier keys</li>
        <li>Special keys</li>
      </ul>The rest of this section details the values used to represent the different keys, as well as the expected behaviour for each key type.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Generally, when emulating user input, the implementation MUST generate
    the same sequence of events that would have been produced if a real user was
    sitting in front of the keyboard and typing the sequence of characters. In
    cases where there is more than one way to type this sequence, the
    implementation SHOULD choose one of the valid ways. For example, typing <code>AB</code> may be achieved by:
    <ul>
      <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'a'</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'b'</li>
      <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
    </ul>
    Alternatively, it can be achieved by:
    <ul>
      <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'a'</li>
      <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
      <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'b'</li>
      <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
    </ul>
    Since both methods are valid, any of them can be used.
    <p>
    The implementation MAY use the following algorithm to generate the events.
    If the implementation is using a different algorithm, it MUST adhere to the
    requirements listed below.
    <p>For each key, <code>key</code> in <code>keysToSend</code>, do
    <ol>
      <li>If <code>key</code> is a lower-case symbol:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>If the Shift key is not pressed:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Generate a pair of key-down and key-up events with <code>key</code> as
          the character to emulate</li>
        </ol>
        <li>else (The Shift key is pressed)</li>
        <ol>
          <li>let <code>uppercaseKey</code> be the upper-case character matching <code>/key</code></li>
          <li>Generate a pair of key-down and key-up events with <code>uppercaseKey</code> as
          the character to emulate</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <li>Else if <code>key</code> is an upper-case symbol:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>If the Shift key is not pressed:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Generate a key-down event of the Shift key.
          <li>Generate a pair of key-down and key-up events with <code>key</code> as
          the character to emulate</li>
          <li>Generate a key-up event of the Shift key.
        </ol>
        <li>else (The Shift key is pressed)</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Generate a pair of key-down and key-up events with <code>key</code> as
          the character to emulate</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <li>Else if <code>key</code> represents a modifier key:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>let <code>modifier</code> be the modifier key represented by
        <code>key</code></li>
        <li>If <code>modifier</code> is currently held down:</li>
        <ol><li>Generate a key-up event of <code>modifier</code></li></ol>
        <li>Else:</li>
        <ol><li>Generate a key-down event of <code>modifier</code></li></ol>
        <li>Store the state of the modifier key globally.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Else if <code>key</code> represents the NULL key:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Generate key-up events of all modifier keys currently held
        down.</li>
        <li>Reset the global state of all modifier keys.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Else if <code>key</code> represents a special key:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Translate <code>key</code> to the special key it represents</li>
        <li>Generate a pair of key-down and key-up events for the special key.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    </p> <!-- Pseudo-code -->
    <p>When not using this algorithm, the implementation must comply with these
    requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>For uppercase letters and symbols that require the Shift key to be
      pressed, a key-down event for the Shift key MUST precede the key events
      for such characters. A single shift key-down event is enough for a
      sequence of uppercase letters.</li>
      <li>A user-specified Shift press implies capitalization of all following
      characters.</li>
      <li>If a user-specified Shift press precedes uppercase letters and
      symbols, a second Shift key-down event MUST NOT be generated. In that
      case, a Shift key-up event MUST NOT be generated implicitly by the
      implementation.</li>
      <li>The NULL key releases all currently held down modifier keys.</li>
      <li>The state of all modifier keys must be reset at the end of each
      <code>sendKeys</code> call and the appropriate key-up events
      generated</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    </p> <!-- Algorithm paragraph -->
    <h3>Character types</h3>
    <p>The <code>keysToSend</code> parameter contains a mix of printable
    characters and pressable keys that aren't text. Press-able keys that aren't
    text are stored in the Unicode PUA (Private Use Area) code points,
    0xE000-0xF8FF. The following table describes the mapping between PUA and
    key:
