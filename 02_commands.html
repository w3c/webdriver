  <h2>Communication between the local end and the remote end</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>The JSON Wire Protocol</h3>
    <p>When the Local End and the Remote End communicate with each other they MUST do so via HTTP. When describing the URL to use for each <code>Command</code> this specification will use URI paths encoded using the scheme described in [[!URI-TEMPLATE]]. The following substitutions are commonly made:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>{sessionId}</dt>
        <dd>The <code>sessionId</code> of the selected session.</dd>

        <dt>{ELEMENT}</dt>
        <dd>The unique identifier of the <code>WebElement</code> instance being referred to</dd>
      </dl>

    <p>The URLs given in this specification MUST have the same path prefix. Implementations are free to redirect those as necessary.</p>

    <p class="note">The reason for doing this is to reduce the complexity of local-end implementations. They need only append the path to a base URL in order to create a working implementation.</p>

      <h3>Handling HTTP requests and responses between the Remote End and Local End</h3>
      <p>When communicating between the local end and the remote end the following algorithm needs to be followed.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="#receiving-http-requests">Receive HTTP request from the local end</a></li>
        <li><a href="#calling-webdriver-commands">Call the WebDriver command</a></li>
        <li><a href="#returning-http-response">Returning HTTP response to the local end</a></li>
      </ol>

      <h4 id='receiving-http-requests'>Receiving HTTP requests from the local end</h4>
      <p>When handling requests from the local end to the remote end we must do the following first and then follow the steps :
      <ol>
        <li>Let <var>sessionid</var> be the value in the {sessionId} section in the [[!URI-TEMPLATE]]</li>
        <li>if {ELEMENT} section in the [[!URI-TEMPLATE]] is populated let <var id='uri-template-element'>element</var> be equal to the {ELEMENT} section</li>
        <li>If the HTTP request is a POST let <var id='post-payload'>payload body</var> contain the
          <a href='http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.12.2'>parsed JSON</a>
         in the payload body of the request.
          If <var>payload body</var> does not <a href='http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.12.2'>parse into JSON</a> return a HTTP response with status code 500 and the payload body containing details of the parsing error if available.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4 id='calling-webdriver-commands'>Call the WebDriver command</h4>
      <p>When the HTTP request has been parsed a call to the underlying WebDriver Command using the following algorithm:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Let <var>command</var> be the command that has the corresponding URI as described throughout this document</li>
        <li>Let <var>response</var> be an initially empty object with the following fields:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><var>status</var>, initially set to <a>success</a>.
            <li><var>value</var>, initially set to null.
          </ul>
        <li>If the <a>session</a>'s <a>alive flag</a> is not set
         and the <a>session</a>'s <a>session ID</a> is not null, run these substeps:
          <ul>
            <li>Set <var>response</var>'s <var>status</var> field to <a>session expired</a>.
            <li>Return <var>response</var>.
          </ul>
        <li>Else if the <a>session</a>'s <a>session ID</a> is null
         and <var>command</var> is not <a href=#newsession>new session</a>, run these substeps:
          <ul>
            <li>Set <var>response</var>'s <var>status</var> field to <a>invalid sessionid</a>.
            <li>Return <var>response</var>.
          </ul>
        <li>Else if <var>session ID</var> is not equal to the <a>session</a>'s <var>session ID</var>,
         run these substeps:
          <ul>
            <li>Set <var>response</var>'s <var>status</var> field to <a>invalid sessionid</a>.
            <li>Return <var>response</var>.
          </ul>
        <li>If evaluating <var>command</var> yielded an error:
          <ul>
            <li>Set <var>response</var>'s <var>status</var> to
             the appropriate status code corresponding to the error,
             or <a>unknown error</a>.
            <li>Return <var>response</var>.
           </ul>
        <li>Let <var>response</var>'s <var>value</var> be the return value
         from the evaluated <var>command</var>.
        <li>Return <var>response</var>.
      </ol>

      <h4 id='returning-http-response'>Returning a HTTP response to the local end</h4>
      <p>when the command has completed encode the result using the following algorithm:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Set the HTTP response status code to 200 unless described differently in the commands below</li>
        <li>Let <var>sessionId</var> be the unique identifier for the current session</li>
        <li>Add the contents of <var>result</var> to an object could be <a href='http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.12.3'>stringified in to JSON</a>
        <li>Let the payload body of the response be the <a href='http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.12.3'>stringified JSON</a>
          object.
          <ol>
            <li>If <a href="#newsession">newSession()</a> is called then the response payload body would look like the following
              <pre>
                {
                  "sessionId" : "string value",

                }.
              </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              If the WebDriver Command has to return data it should be the whole of the response payload body and look like the following
              <pre>
                {
                  "value": "data from WebDriver Commands"

              </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              If the WebDriver Command results in an error then the response payload body would look like the following
              <pre>
                {
                  "status": "string value",
                  "value" : "string message"
                }
              </pre>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Set HTTP headers for the follow keys and their values.
          <ul>
            <li><code>cache-control: no-cache</code></li>

    <h2>Handling of Status Codes at the Local End</h2>

    <p>Status codes are returned from the <a href="#remote-end">remote end</a> to the <a href="#local-end">local end</a>. The <a href="#local-end">local end</a> SHOULD convert these into a form appropriate for the implementation language. For example, in C the status codes might be converted to constant integer values, whereas in Java various exceptions could be thrown.</p>

    <p>Implementations of the <a href="#local-end">local end</a> written in languages that support exceptions SHOULD make use of an exception hierarchy rooted on a <code>WebDriverException</code> (or similarly named base exception class). Where references to <code>WebDriverException</code> are made in this specification, we are referring to this local end conversion of status codes to local end exceptions.</p>

    <p class="note">The reason for this is to allow users of the local end to easily handle the all expected failure modes of a local WebDriver implementation by catching the <code>WebDriverException</code>.</p>

     <p class="note">It is strongly recommended that the <code>WebDriverException</code> contain as much diagnostic information as possible, including version numbers and details about the remote end. This is because experience suggests that when reporting errors from tests using WebDriver, users will simply cut-and-paste a stack trace of an exception. Adding this information to the exception makes the task of debugging problems considerably easier.</p>
