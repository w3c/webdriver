  <h2>Navigation</h2>
  <p>Almost all usages of the WebDriver API begin by navigating to a particular URL. This section not only describes the commands used for navigation, but also describes when commands must be processed.</p>

  <p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support navigating between different HTTP domains and between HTTPS and HTTP domains if the underlying browser supports this.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="page-load-strategies">Page Load Strategies</h2>

    <table class="simple">
      <tr><td>Capability Name</td><td>Type</td></tr>
      <tr><td><span id="capability-pageLoadingStrategy">pageLoadingStrategy</span></td><td>DOMString</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>It is possible to request a particular strategy be used for detecting when the next command should be processed by a remote end implementation by modifying the page load strategy that is used. The following are the expected values that MAY be used when creating a new session:</p>

    <h4>'normal'</h4>
    <p>The remote end MUST wait until the "<code>document.readyState</code>" of the frame currently handling commands equals "<code>complete</code>", or there are no more outstanding network requests other than XMLHttpRequests.</p>

    <h3>'eager'</h3>
    <p>The remote end MUST wait until the "<code>document.readyState</code>" of frame currently handling equals "<code>interactive</code>" or "<code>complete</code>", or there are no more outstanding network requests.</p>

    <h3>'none'</h3>
    <p>The remote end MUST not do any checks against "<code>document.readyState</code>".</p>

    <p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support the <code>normal</code> and <code>eager</code> modes and SHOULD support the <code>conservative</code> and <code>none</code> modes. If no page loading strategy is chosen, then <code>normal</code> MUST be the default.
    In addition, implementors MAY add additional page loading strategies.</p>

        <p>The "get" command is used to cause the browser to navigate to a new location, and is named after the HTTP verb. From a user's point of view, this is as if they have entered the "url" into the URL bar. When the command returns is based on the <a href="#page-load-strategies">page load strategy</a> that the user has selected with the following exceptions when the strategy is not "none":

        <ul>
          <li>HTTP redirects MUST be automatically followed without responding to the command.</li>
          <li>When a page contains a META tag with the "http-equiv" attribute set to "refresh", a response MUST be returned if the timeout is greater than 1 second and the other criteria for determining whether a page is loaded are met. When the refresh period is 1 second or less and the page loading strategy is "normal" or "conservative" implementations MUST wait for the refresh to complete before responding.</li>
          <li>If any modal dialog box, such as those opened by on <code>window.onbeforeunload</code> or <code>window.alert</code>, is opened at any point in the page load, a response MUST be sent.</li>
          <li>If a 401 response is seen by the browser, a response MUST be sent. That is, if BASIC, DIGEST, NTLM or similar authentication is required, the page load is assumed to be complete. This does not include FORM-based authentication.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> If the page takes too long <a href="#timeouts">as specified by the timeouts</a> a <code><a href="#status-timeout">timeout</a></code> error MUST be raised. If the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context'>top level browsing context</a> currently receiving commands is no longer open a <code><a href="#no-such-window">no such window</a></code> error MUST be raised.

        <tr><td><span id="capability-securessl">secureSsl</span></td><td>boolean</td></tr>

      <p>WebDriver implementations MUST support users accessing sites served via HTTPS. Access to those sites using self-signed or invalid certificates, and where the certificate does not match the serving domain MUST be the same as if the HTTPS was configured properly.</p>

      <p class="note">The reason for this is that implementations of this spec are often used for testing. It's a sorry fact that many QA engineers and testers are asked to verify that apps work on sites that have insecure HTTPS configurations</p>


      <p>The exception to requirement is if the <a>Capabilities</a> used to initialize has the WebDriver session had the capability <code>secureSsl</code> set to true. In this case, implementations MAY choose to make accessing a site with bad HTTPS configurations cause a <code>WebDriverException</code> to be thrown. Remote end implementations MUST return an <code><a href="#status-unknown-error">unknown error</a></code> status in this case. If this is the case, the <a>Capabilities</a> describing the session MUST also set the <code>secureSsl</code> capability to "true".</p>

      <h3>Detecting When to Handle Commands</h3>

      <p>Commands MUST only be processed when the <span id="page-loading-strategies">page loading strategy</span> being used indicates that page loading is complete.</p>

      <p>Commands SHOULD be handled in a synchronous fashion. Requests should be received and then a response sent when the Command has completed.</p>
