<p>
WebDriver is a remote control interface
that enables introspection and control of user agents.
It provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol
as a way for out-of-process programs
to remotely instruct the behavior of web browsers.

<p>
Provided is a set of interfaces
to discover and manipulate DOM elements in web documents
and to control the behavior of a user agent.
It is primarily intended to allow web authors to write tests
that automate a user agent from a separate controlling process,
but may also be used in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts
to control a — possibly separate — browser.

<section class=informative>
<h2>Design</h2>

<p>
The WebDriver standard attempts to follow a number of design goals:

<section>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<p>
This specification is derived from the popular
<a href=https://selenium.dev>Selenium WebDriver</a> browser automation framework.
Selenium is a long-lived project,
and due to its age and breadth of use
it has a wide range of expected functionality.
This specification uses these expectations to inform its design.
Where improvements or clarifications have been made,
they have been made with care to allow existing users of Selenium WebDriver
to avoid unexpected breakages.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>

<p>
The largest intended group of users of this specification
are software developers and testers
writing automated tests and other tooling,
such as monitoring or load testing, that relies on automating a browser.
As such, care has been taken to provide commands
that simplify common tasks such as <a data-lt="Element Send Keys">typing into</a>
and <a data-lt="Element Click">clicking</a> elements.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Extensions</h3>

<p>
WebDriver provides a mechanism for others to define extensions to the protocol
for the purposes of automating functionality that cannot be implemented entirely
in <a href=https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/>ECMAScript</a>. This allows other
web standards to support the automation of new platform features. It also
allows vendors to expose functionality that is specific to their browser.
</section>
</section> <!-- /Design Notes -->


<section id="conformance">
<p>
Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms
or specific steps may be implemented in any manner,
so long as the end result is equivalent.
Algorithms in this document are typically written with readability,
rather than performance, in mind.
</section>


<section>
<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>
In equations, all numbers are integers,
addition is represented by “+”,
subtraction by “−”,
division by “÷”,
and bitwise OR by “|”.
The characters “(” and “)” are used to provide logical grouping in these contexts.

<p>
The mathematical function
<dfn>min</dfn>(<var>value</var>, <var>value</var>[, <var>value</var>])
returns the smallest item of two or more values.
Conversely, the function
<dfn>max</dfn>(<var>value</var>, <var>value</var>[, <var>value</var>])
returns the largest item of two or more values.

<p>
The mathematical function <dfn>floor</dfn>(<var>value</var>)
produces the largest integer, closest to positive infinity,
that is not larger than <var>value</var>.

<p>
A <dfn data-lt=uuid>Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)</dfn>
is a 128 bits long URN that requires no central registration process.
<dfn>Generating a UUID</dfn> means
<i>Creating a UUID From Truly Random or Pseudo-Random Numbers</i>,
and converting it to the string representation.
[[RFC4122]]

<p>
The <dfn data-lt="Unix timestamp">Unix Epoch</dfn>
is a value that approximates the number of seconds
that have elapsed since the Epoch,
as described by The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7
<a href=https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_15>section 4.15</a> (IEEE Std 1003.1).

<p>
An <dfn>integer</dfn> is a <a>Number</a> that is unchanged
under the <a>ToInteger</a> operation.

<p>
The <dfn>initial value</dfn> of an ECMAScript property
is the value defined by the platform for that property,
i.e. the value it would have in the absence of any shadowing by content script.

<!--
‘Chrome’ definition is borrowed
from Web Security Context: User Interface Guidelines:
https://www.w3.org/TR/wsc-ui/#def-chrome
-->
<p>
The <dfn>browser chrome</dfn> is a non-normative term
to refer to the representation through which the user
interacts with the user agent itself,
as distinct from the accessed web content.
Examples of <dfn data-lt="browser chrome element">browser chrome elements</dfn>
include, but are not limited to,
toolbars (such as the bookmark toolbar),
menus (such as the file or context menu),
buttons (such as the back and forward buttons),
door hangers (such as security and certificate indicators),
and decorations (such as operating system widget borders).
</section> <!-- /Terminology -->


<section>
<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>
The <dfn>webdriver-active flag</dfn>
is set to true when the user agent is under remote control.
It is initially false.

<pre class=idl>
interface mixin NavigatorAutomationInformation {
  readonly attribute boolean webdriver;
};
Navigator includes NavigatorAutomationInformation;
</pre>

<p class=note>
The {{NavigatorAutomationInformation}} interface
should not be exposed on {{WorkerNavigator}}.

<dl>
<dt><dfn>webdriver</dfn>
<dd>
<p>Returns true if <a>webdriver-active flag</a> is set, false otherwise.
</dl>

<aside class=example>
<p>
For web authors (non-normative):

<dl>
<dt><code>navigator</code>.<a><code>webdriver</code></a>
<dd><p>
Defines a standard way for co-operating user agents
to inform the document that it is controlled by WebDriver,
for example so that alternate code paths can be triggered during automation.
</dl>
</aside>

<p style="display: none">
It is acknowledged that this is complementary to the Evil Bit [[RFC3514]].
</section>

<section>
<h2>Nodes</h2>

<p>The WebDriver protocol consists of communication between:

<dl>
 <dt><dfn data-lt="local ends|local">Local end</dfn>
 <dd><p>The local end represents the client side of the protocol,
  which is usually in the form of language-specific libraries
  providing an API on top of the WebDriver <a href=#protocol>protocol</a>.
  This specification does not place any restrictions on the details of those libraries
  above the level of the wire protocol.

 <dt><dfn data-lt="remote ends|remote">Remote end</dfn>
 <dd>The remote end hosts the server side of the <a href=#protocol>protocol</a>.
  Defining the behavior of a remote end in response to the WebDriver protocol
  forms the largest part of this specification.
</dl>

<p>For <a>remote ends</a> the standard defines two broad conformance
 classes, known as <dfn data-lt="node type">node types</dfn>:

<dl>
 <dt><dfn data-lt="intermediary nodes">Intermediary node</dfn>
 <dd>Intermediary nodes are those that act as proxies, implementing
  both the <a>local end</a> and <a>remote end</a> of
  the <a href=#protocol>protocol</a>.  However they are not expected
  to implement <a>remote end steps</a> directly. All nodes between a
  specific <a>intermediary node</a> and a <a>local end</a> are said to
  be <dfn data-lt="downstream node">downstream</dfn> of that
  node. Conversely, any nodes between a specific <a>intermediary
  node</a> and an <a>endpoint node</a> are said to
  be <dfn data-lt="upstream node">upstream</dfn>.

 <dt><dfn>Endpoint node</dfn>
 <dd>An endpoint node is the final <a>remote end</a>
  in a chain of nodes that is not an <a>intermediary node</a>.
  The endpoint node is implemented by a user agent or a similar program.
</dl>

<p>All remote end <a>node types</a> must be black-box indistinguishable
  from a <a>remote end</a>, from the point of view of <a>local end</a>,
  and so are bound by the requirements on a <a>remote end</a> in terms
  of the wire protocol.

<p>
The <dfn>readiness state</dfn> of a <a>remote end</a>
indicates whether it is free to accept new connections.
It must be false if the maximum <a>active sessions</a>
is equal to the length of the list of <a>active sessions</a>,
or if the node is an <a>intermediary node</a>
and is known to be in a state in which attempting to create <a>new sessions</a> would fail.
In all other cases it must be true.

<p class=example>If the <a>intermediary node</a>
 is a multiplexer that manages
 multiple <a data-lt="endpoint node">endpoint nodes</a>,
 this might indicate its ability to purvey more <a>sessions</a>,
 for example if it has hit its maximum capacity.
</section> <!-- /Nodes -->

<section>
<h2>Protocol</h2>

<p>WebDriver <a>remote ends</a> must provide
 an <a>HTTP compliant</a> wire protocol
 where the <a>endpoints</a> map to different <a>commands</a>.

<p>As this standard only defines the <a>remote end</a> protocol,
 it puts no demands to how <a>local ends</a> should be implemented.
 <a>Local ends</a> are only expected to be compatible to the extent
 that they can speak the <a>remote end</a>’s protocol;
 no requirements are made upon their exposed user-facing API.

<section>
<h3>Algorithms</h3>

<p>Various parts of this specification are written in terms of step-by-step algorithms.
 The details of these algorithms do not have any normative significance;
 implementations are free to adopt any implementation strategy
 that produces equivalent output to the specification.
 In particular, algorithms in this document are optimized
 for readability rather than performance.

<p>Where algorithms that return values are fallible,
 they are written in terms of returning either
 <dfn class="export">success</dfn> or <dfn class="export">error</dfn>.
 A <a>success</a> value has an associated <var>data</var> field
 which encapsulates the value returned,
 whereas an <a>error</a> response has an associated <a>error code</a>.

<p>When calling a fallible algorithm,
 the construct “Let <var>result</var> be the result
 of <dfn data-lt="try">trying</dfn> to call <var>algorithm</var>”
 is equivalent to

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>temp</var> be the result of calling <var>algorithm</var>.

 <li><p>If <var>temp</var> is an <a>error</a> return <var>temp</var>,
  otherwise let <var>result</var> be <var>temp</var>’s <var>data</var> field.
</ol>

<p>The result of <dfn data-lt="getting properties|getting the
 property">getting a property</dfn> with <var>name</var>
 from <var>object</var> is defined as being the same as the result of
 calling  <a>Object.[[\GetOwnProperty]]</a>(<var>name</var>) on <var>object</var>.

<p>The result of <dfn data-lt="getting the property with
 default">getting a property with default</dfn> with
 arguments <var>name</var> and <var>default</var>
 from <var>object</var> is defined as being the same as the result of
 calling
 <a>Object.[[\GetOwnProperty]]</a>(<var>name</var>)
 on <var>object</var> if that results in a value other
 than <code>undefined</code> and <var>default</var> otherwise.

<p><dfn data-lt='set a property'>Setting a property</dfn> with
 arguments <var>name</var> and <var>value</var> on <var>object</var>
 is defined as being the same as calling
 <a>Object.[[\Put]]</a>(<var>name</var>, <var>value</var>) on <var>object</var>.

<p>The result of <dfn>JSON serialization</dfn> with <var>object</var>
  of type JSON <a>Object</a> is defined as the result of
  calling <a>stringify</a>(<var>object</var>).

<p>The result of <dfn data-lt='parsing as json'>JSON deserialization</dfn> with <var>text</var> is defined as
  the result of calling <a>parse</a>(<var>text</var>).
</section> <!-- /Algorithms -->


<section>
<h3>Commands</h3>

<p>
The WebDriver protocol is organized into <a>commands</a>.
Each <a>HTTP request</a> with a method and template defined in this specification
represents a single <dfn data-lt=commands>command</dfn>,
and therefore each command produces a single <a>HTTP response</a>.

<p>
In response to a <a>command</a>,
a <a>remote end</a> will run a series of actions
known as <dfn class="export">remote end steps</dfn>.
These provide the sequences of actions that a <a>remote end</a> takes
when it receives a particular <a>command</a>.
</section>


<section>
<h3>Processing model</h3>

<p>The <a>remote end</a> is an HTTP server
 reading requests from the client and writing responses,
 typically over a TCP socket.
 For the purposes of this specification we model the data transmission between
 a particular <a>local end</a> and <a>remote end</a> with a <dfn>connection</dfn>
 to which the <a>remote end</a> may <dfn>write bytes</dfn> and <dfn>read bytes</dfn>.
 However the exact details of how this <a>connection</a> works
 and how it is established are out of scope.

<p>After such a <a>connection</a> has been established,
 a <a>remote end</a> must run the following steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p><a>Read bytes</a> from the <a>connection</a> until a
  complete <a>HTTP request</a> can be constructed from the data.
  Let <var>request</var> be a <a>request</a> constructed from the
  received data, according to the requirements of [[RFC7230]]. If it
  is not possible to construct a complete <a>HTTP request</a>,
  the <a>remote end</a> must either close the <a>connection</a>,
  return an HTTP response with status code 500, or return
  an <a>error</a> with <a>error code</a> <a>unknown error</a>.

 <li><p>Let <var>request match</var> be the result of the algorithm
  to <a>match a request</a> with <var>request</var>’s
  <a>method</a> and <a>URL</a> as arguments.

 <li><p>If <var>request match</var> is of type <a>error</a>,
  <a>send an error</a> with <var>request match</var>’s <a>error code</a>
  and jump to step 1.

  <p>Otherwise, let <var>command</var> and <var>command parameters</var>
   be <var>request match</var>’s data. Let <var>url variables</var> be a
   <a>url variables</a> dictionary mapping the <var>command parameters</var>
   to their corresponding values.

  <li><p>If <var>session id</var> is among the variables defined by <var>command parameters</var>:

   <p class=note>This condition is intended to exclude the <a>New Session</a> and <a>Status</a>
    <a>commands</a> and any <a>extension commands</a> which do not operate on a particular <a>session</a>.

  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <var>session id</var> be the corresponding variable
    from <var>command parameters</var>.

   <li><p>Let the <a>current session</a> be the <a>session</a>
    with <a data-lt="session id">ID</a> <var>session id</var>
    in the list of <a>active sessions</a>,
    or <a><code>null</code></a> if there is no such matching <a>session</a>.

   <li><p>If the <a>current session</a> is <a><code>null</code></a>
   <a>send an error</a> with <a>error code</a> <a>invalid session id</a>,
   then jump to step 1 in this overall algorithm.

   <li><p>If the <a>current session</a> is not <a><code>null</code></a>:

    <ol>
      <li><p>Enqueue <var>request</var>
       in the <a>current session</a>’s <a>request queue</a>.

      <li><p>Wait until the first element
       in the <a>current session</a>’s <a>request queue</a>
       is <var>request</var>:

      <li><p>Dequeue <var>request</var> from the <a>current session</a>’s <a>request queue</a>.

      <li><p>If the list of <a>active sessions</a> no longer contains the <a>current session</a>,
       set the <a>current session</a> to <a><code>null</code></a>.
    </ol>
  </ol>

 <li><p>If <var>request</var>’s <a>method</a> is POST:

  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <var>parse result</var> be the result of
    <a>parsing as JSON</a> with <var>request</var>’s
    <a>body</a> as the argument. If this process throws an exception,
    return an <a>error</a> with <a>error code</a> <a>invalid
    argument</a> and jump back to step 1 in this overall algorithm.

   <li><p>If <var>parse result</var> is not an <a>Object</a>,
    <a>send an error</a> with <a>error code</a> <a>invalid argument</a>
    and jump back to step 1 in this overall algorithm.

    <p>Otherwise, let <var>parameters</var> be <var>parse result</var>.
  </ol>

  <p>Otherwise, let <var>parameters</var> be <a><code>null</code></a>.

 <li><p><a>Wait for navigation to complete</a>. If this returns
  an <a>error</a> <a data-lt="send an error">return its value</a> and
  jump to step 1 in this overall algorithm, otherwise continue.

 <li><p>Let <var>response result</var> be the return value
  obtained by running the <a>remote end steps</a> for <var>command</var>
  with an argument named <var>url variables</var> whose value is
  <var>url variables</var> and an
  additional argument named <var>parameters</var> whose value is
  <var>parameters</var>.

 <li><p>If <var>response result</var> is an <a>error</a>,
  <a>send an error</a> with <a>error code</a>
  equal to <var>response result</var>’s <a>error code</a>
  and jump back to step 1 in this overall algorithm.

  <p>Otherwise, if <var>response result</var> is a <a>success</a>,
   let <var>response data</var> be <var>response result</var>’s data.

 <li><p><a>Send a response</a> with status 200 and <var>response data</var>.

 <li><p>Jump to step 1.
</ol>

<p>When required to <dfn>send an error</dfn>,
 with <var>error code</var>
 and an optional <var>error data</var> dictionary,
 a <a>remote end</a> must run the following steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>status</var> and <var>name</var>
  be the <a>error response data</a> for <var>error code</var>.

 <li><p>Let <var>message</var> be an implementation-defined string
  containing a human-readable description of the reason for the error.

 <li><p>Let <var>stacktrace</var> be an implementation-defined string
  containing a stack trace report of the active stack frames
  at the time when the error occurred.

  <p>Let <var>body</var> be a new JSON <a>Object</a>
   initialized with the following properties:

  <dl>
   <dt>"<code>error</code>"
   <dd><var>name</var>

   <dt>"<code>message</code>"
   <dd><var>message</var>

   <dt>"<code>stacktrace</code>"
   <dd><var>stacktrace</var>
  </dl>

 <li><p>If the <a>error data</a> dictionary contains any entries,
  set the "<code>data</code>" field on <var>body</var>
  to a new JSON <a>Object</a> populated with the dictionary.

 <li><p><a>Send a response</a> with <var>status</var>
  and <var>body</var> as arguments.
</ol>

<p>When required to <dfn>send a response</dfn>,
 with arguments <var>status</var> and <var>data</var>,
 a <a>remote end</a> must run the following steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>response</var> be a new <a>response</a>.

 <li><p>Set <var>response</var>’s <a>HTTP status</a> to <var>status</var>,
  and <a>status message</a> to the string corresponding
  to the description of <var>status</var> in the <a>status code registry</a>.

 <li><p><a data-lt="set header">Set</a> the <var>response</var>’s <a>header</a>
  with <a data-lt="header name">name</a>
  and <a data-lt="header value">value</a>

  <dl>
   <dt><code>Content-Type</code>
   <dd>"<code>application/json; charset=utf-8</code>"

   <dt><code>Cache-Control</code>
   <dd>"<code>no-cache</code>"
  </dl>

 <li><p>Let <var>response</var>’s <a>body</a> be
  the <a data-lt="utf-8 encode">UTF-8 encoded</a> <a>JSON
  serialization</a> of a JSON <a>Object</a> with a key
  "<code>value</code>" set to <var>data</var>.

 <li><p>Let <var>response bytes</var> be the byte sequence resulting
  from serializing <var>response</var> according to the rules in [[RFC7230]].

 <li><p><a data-lt="write bytes">Write</a> <var>response bytes</var>
  to the <a>connection</a>.
</ol>
<p>A <dfn data-lt="url variables">url variable</dfn> dictionary is defined
  as the mapping of a <a>command</a>’s <a>URI template</a> variable names
  to their corresponding values.

<section>
<h3>Routing requests</h3>

<p><dfn data-lt="routing requests">Request routing</dfn>
 is the process of going from a <a>HTTP request</a>
 to the <a data-lt="remote end steps">series of steps</a> needed
 to implement the <a>command</a> represented by that request.

<p>A <a>remote end</a> has an associated <dfn>URL prefix</dfn>,
 which is used as a prefix on all WebDriver-defined URLs on that <a>remote end</a>.
 This must either be <a>undefined</a> or a <a>path-absolute URL</a>.

<aside class=example>
 <p>For example a <a>remote end</a> wishing
  to run alongside other services on <code>example.com</code>
  might set its <a>URL prefix</a> to <code>/wd</code>
  so that a <a>new session</a> <a>command</a> would be invoked
  by sending a POST request to <code>/wd/session</code>,
  rather than <code>/session</code>.
</aside>

<p>In order to <dfn>match a request</dfn> given
 a <a><var>method</var></a> and <a><var>URL</var></a>,
 the following steps must be taken:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>endpoints</var> be a list
  containing each row in the <a>table of endpoints</a>.

 <li><p>Remove each entry from <var>endpoints</var>
  for which the concatenation of the <a>URL prefix</a>
  and the entry’s <a>URI template</a>
  does not match <var>URL</var>’s <a>path</a>.

 <li><p>If there are no entries in <var>endpoints</var>,
  return <a>error</a> with <a>error code</a> <a>unknown command</a>.

 <li><p>Remove each entry in <var>endpoints</var>
  for which the <i>method</i> column
  is not equal to <var>method</var>.

 <li><p>If there are no entries in <var>endpoints</var>,
  return <a>error</a> with <a>error code</a> <a>unknown method</a>.

 <li><p>There is now exactly one entry in <var>endpoints</var>;
  let <var>entry</var> be this entry.

 <li><p>Let <var>parameters</var> be the result of extracting the variables
  from <var>URL</var> using <var>entry</var>’s <a>URI template</a>.

 <li><p>Let <var>command</var> be <var>entry</var>’s <a>command</a>.

<h3>Errors</h3>

<p><a>Errors</a> are represented in the WebDriver protocol
 by an <a>HTTP response</a> with an <a>HTTP status</a> in the 4xx or 5xx range,
 and a JSON body containing details of the <a>error</a>.
 The body is a JSON <a>Object</a>
 and has a field named "<code>value</code>"
 whose value is an object bearing three, and sometimes four, fields:
 <ul>
  <li>"<code>error</code>", containing a string indicating the <a>error code</a>.
  <li>"<code>message</code>", containing an implementation-defined string
   with a human readable description of the kind of error that occurred.
  <li>"<code>stacktrace</code>", containing an implementation-defined string
   with a stack trace report of the active stack frames at the time when the error occurred.
  <li>Optionally "<code>data</code>", which is a JSON <a>Object</a>
   with additional <a>error data</a> helpful in diagnosing the error.
 </ul>

<aside class=example>
 <p>A <code>GET</code> request to <code>/session/1234/url</code>,
 where <code>1234</code> is not the <a>session id</a> of a <a>current session</a>
 would return an <a>HTTP response</a> with the status 404 and a body of the form:

 <pre><code>{
	"value": {
		"error": "invalid session id",
		"message": "No active session with ID 1234",
		"stacktrace": ""
	}
}</code></pre>

 <p>Certain commands may also annotate <a>errors</a>
  with additional <a>error data</a>.
  Notably, this is the case for commands
  which invoke the <a>user prompt handler</a>,
  where the <a>user prompt message</a>
  may be included in a "<code>text</code>" field:

 <pre><code>{
	"value": {
		"error": "unexpected alert open",
		"message": "",
		"stacktrace": "",
		"data": {
			"text": "Message from window.alert"
		}
	}
}</code></pre>
</aside>

<p>The following table lists each <dfn>error code</dfn>,
 its associated <a>HTTP status</a>,
 JSON <code>error</code> code,
 and a non-normative description of the error.
 The <dfn>error response data</dfn> for a particular <a>error code</a>
 is the values of the <i>HTTP Status</i>
 and <i>JSON Error Code</i> columns for the row corresponding to that <a>error code</a>.

<h3>Extensions</h3>

<p>Using the terminology defined in this section, others may define additional
 commands that seamlessly integrate with the standard protocol. This allows
 vendors to expose functionality that is specific to their user agent, and it
 also allows other web standards to define commands for automating new platform
 features.

<p>Commands defined in this way
 are called <dfn class="export">extension commands</dfn>
 and behave no differently than other <a>commands</a>;
 each has a dedicated HTTP endpoint and a set of <a>remote end steps</a>.

<p>Each <a>extension command</a> has an associated
 <dfn class="export">extension command URI Template</dfn>
 that is a <a>URI Template</a> string,
 and which should bear some resemblance to what the command performs.
 This value,
 along with the HTTP method and <a>extension command</a>,
 is added to the <a>table of endpoints</a>
 and thus follows the same rules for <a>request routing</a>
 as that of other built-in <a>commands</a>.

<p>In order to avoid potential resource conflicts with other implementations,
 vendor-specific <a data-lt="extension command URI Template">extension command URI Templates</a> must begin with one
 or more path segments which uniquely identifies the vendor and UA.
 It is suggested that vendors use their vendor prefixes
 without additional characters as outlined in [[CSS21]],
 notably in <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords>section 4.1.2.2 on <i>vendor keywords</i></a>,
 as the name for this path element,
 and include a vendor-chosen UA identifier.

<aside class=note>
 If the <a>extension command URI Template</a> includes a variable named
 <var>session id</var>, the value of this variable will be used to define the
 <a>current session</a> during command processing.
</aside>

<aside class=example>
 <p>This might lead to a URL of the form
  <code>/session/5d376174-36f0-11e5-9b9a-6bdf200a3f7f/<em>ms</em>/<em>edge</em>/<em>context</em></code>,
  where <code>session/{<var>session id</var>}</code> associates the request
  with the specified session, <code>ms/edge</code> identifies the command as
  specific to the Edge browser distributed by Microsoft,
  and <code>context</code> describes the functionality
  that, in the context of Edge, allows a <a>local end</a>
  to switch between browser-specific contexts.
  Requesting this URL will call the <a>extension command</a>’s
  <a>remote end steps</a>.
</aside>

<p>Other specifications may define <dfn data-lt="additional WebDriver
capability">additional WebDriver capabilities</dfn>. Each defined
capability must have a <dfn>capability name</dfn> which is a string
not containing a "<code>:</code>" (colon) character,
an <dfn>additional capability deserialization algorithm</dfn> which is
a set of steps taking a single argument <var>value</var> which has a
JSON type, returning either <a>success</a> wrapping the deserialized
capability value or <a>error</a>.

<p>An <a>additional WebDriver capability</a> may also define
a <dfn>matched capability serialization algorithm</dfn>, which is a
set of steps used to determine if a capability is matched by the
current implementation and provide any computed value to return to the
user. This set of steps takes a single argument <var>value</var>,
which is the output of the corresponding <a>additional capability
deserialization algorithm</a>, and returns
either <a><code>null</code></a> to indicate the capability is not
matched, or a non-null JSON-serializable value if the capability is
matched.

<p>Other specifications may also define <dfn class="export">WebDriver
new session algorithms</dfn>, which are
called just after a new session is created, and before the <a>new
session</a> response is sent to the <a>remote end</a>. These
algorithms are called with <var>session</var> representing the
WebDriver session that will be established, and
<var>capabilities</var>, the capabilities object that will be returned
to the <a>remote end</a>. It is permitted for such an algorithm to
modify any entry in the capabilities object with a name that's an
<a>additional WebDriver capability</a> defined by the same
specification.

<p><a>Remote ends</a> may also introduce
 <dfn data-lt="extension capability">extension capabilities</dfn>
 that are extra <a>capabilities</a>
 used to provide configuration or fulfill other vendor-specific needs.
 Extension capabilities’ key
 must contain a "<code>:</code>" (colon) character,
 denoting an implementation specific namespace.
 The value can be arbitrary JSON types.

<p>As with <a>extension commands</a>,
 it is suggested that the key used to denote
 the <a>extension capability</a> namespace
 is based on the <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords>vendor keywords</a>
 listed in [[CSS21]]
 and precedes the first "<code>:</code>" character in the string.

<aside class=example>
 <p><a>Extension capabilities</a> are typically used
  to provide UA or <a>intermediary node</a> specific configuration
  that is not handled by the <a>table of standard capabilities</a>.

 <p>An example <a>new session</a> request body
  might look like this:

 <pre>{
  "capabilities": {
    "alwaysMatch": {
      // browser specific configuration
      "&lt;prefix&gt;:browserOptions": {
        "binary": "/usr/bin/browser-binary",
        "args": ["--start-page=https://example.com"],
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</aside>

</section> <!-- /Protocol -->

<section>
<h2>Capabilities</h2>

<p>WebDriver <dfn data-lt="capability">capabilities</dfn>
 are used to communicate the features supported by a given implementation.
 The <a>local end</a> may use capabilities
 to define which features it requires the <a>remote end</a>
 to satisfy when creating a <a>new session</a>.
 Likewise, the <a>remote end</a> uses capabilities
 to describe the full feature set for a <a>session</a>.

<p>The following <dfn>table of standard capabilities</dfn>
 enumerates the capabilities each implementation must support.
 An implementation may define additional <a>extension capabilities</a>.

<aside class="example">
<p>As an example, Mozilla could elect to hide new features behind capabilities
with a "<code>moz:</code>" prefix:

<pre>{
	"browserName": "firefox",

<aside class=note>
 <p>The algorithm outlined in <a>matching capabilities</a>
  blithely ignores real-world problems
  that make implementation less than perfectly straightforward,
  particularly since capabilities can interact in unforeseen ways.

 <p>As an example, an implementation could have a capability
  that gives the path to the browser binary to use.
  This could cause both <code>browserName</code> and <code>browserVersion</code>
  to be impossible to match against until the browser process is started.
</aside>

<p>When <dfn>matching capabilities</dfn>
 with JSON <a>Object</a> argument <var>capabilities</var>,
 an <a>endpoint node</a> must take the following steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>matched capabilities</var> be a JSON <a>Object</a>
  with the following entries:

  <dl>
   <dt>"<code>browserName</code>"
   <dd>[=ASCII Lowercase=] name of the user agent as a <a>string</a>.

   <dt>"<code>browserVersion</code>"
   <dd>The user agent version, as a <a>string</a>.

   <dt>"<code>platformName</code>"
   <dd>[=ASCII Lowercase=] name of the current platform as a <a>string</a>.

   <dt>"<code>acceptInsecureCerts</code>"
   <dd><a>Boolean</a> initially set to false,
    indicating the session will not implicitly trust untrusted
    or self-signed TLS certificates on <a>navigation</a>.

   <dt>"<code>strictFileInteractability</code>"
    <dd><a>Boolean</a> initially set to false,
    indicating that interactability checks will be applied to
    &lt;input type=file&gt;.

   <dt>"<code>setWindowRect</code>"
   <dd>Boolean indicating whether the <a>remote end</a> supports all of the <a href=#resizing-and-positioning-windows>resizing and positioning</a> <a>commands</a>.
  </dl>

 <li><p>Optionally add <a>extension capabilities</a> as entries
  to <var>matched capabilities</var>. The values of these may be
  elided, and there is no requirement that all
  <a>extension capabilities</a> be added.

  <aside class=note>
  <p>
   This allows a <a>remote end</a> to add information that might be
   useful to a <a>local end</a> without unnecessarily bloating the
   response sent back to the user with (e.g.) an entire browser
   profile.

  <p>
   For example, an implementation could choose to indicate that a
   screenshot will be taken when returning an error by setting the
   capability <code>se:screenshot-on-error</code>
   to <code>true</code>.
  </aside>

 <li><p>For each <var>name</var> and <var>value</var> corresponding

     <p class=note>There is a chance the <a>remote end</a> will need
      to start a browser process to correctly determine
      the <code>browserName</code>. Lightweight checks are preferred
      before this is done.

     <dt>"<code>browserVersion</code>"
     <dd><p>Compare <var>value</var>
       to the "<code>browserVersion</code>" entry in <var>matched capabilities</var>
       using an implementation-defined comparison algorithm.
       The comparison is to accept a <var>value</var>
       that places constraints on the version using
       the "<code>&lt;</code>", "<code>&lt;=</code>", "<code>&gt;</code>",
       and "<code>&gt;=</code>" operators.

      <p>If the two values do not match,
       return <a>success</a> with data <a><code>null</code></a>.

      <p class=note>Version comparison is left as an implementation detail
       since each user agent will likely have conflicting methods
       of encoding the user agent version,
       and standardizing these schemes is beyond the scope of this standard.

     <p class=note>There is a chance the <a>remote end</a> will need

       <p>The following platform names are in common usage with

<h2>Sessions</h2>

<p>A <a>session</a> is equivalent to a single instantiation of a particular user agent,
 including all its child browsers.
 WebDriver gives each <a>session</a> a unique <a>session ID</a>
 that can be used to differentiate one session from another,
 allowing multiple user agents to be controlled from a single HTTP server,
 and allowing sessions to be routed via a multiplexer
 (known as an <a>intermediary node</a>).

<p>A WebDriver <dfn class="export">session</dfn> represents
 the <a>connection</a> between a <a>local end</a> and a specific <a>remote end</a>.

<p>A <a>session</a> is started when
 a <a>New Session</a> is invoked.
 It is an <a>error</a> to send any commands before starting a session,
 or to continue to send commands after
 the <a>session</a> has been closed.
 Maintaining session continuity between <a>commands</a> to
 the <a>remote end</a> requires passing a <a>session ID</a>.

<p>A <a>session</a> is torn down at some later point;
 either explicitly by invoking <a>Delete Session</a>,
 or implicitly when <a>Close Window</a> is called
 at the last remaining <a>top-level browsing context</a>.

<p>An <a>intermediary node</a> will maintain an <dfn>associated
 session</dfn> for each active <a>session</a>. This is
 the <a>session</a> on the <a>upstream</a> neighbor that is created
 when the <a>intermediary node</a> executes the <a>New
 Session</a> <a>command</a>. Closing a <a>session</a> on
 an <a>intermediary node</a> will also <a>close the session</a> of
 the <a>associated session</a>.

<p>All <a>commands</a>, except <a>New Session</a> and <a>Status</a>,
 have an associated <dfn>current session</dfn>,
 which is the <a>session</a> in which that <a>command</a> will run.

<p>A <a>remote end</a> has an associated list of
 <dfn data-lt="active session">active sessions</dfn>,
 which is a list of all <a>sessions</a> that are currently started.
 A <a>remote end</a> that is not an <a>intermediary node</a>
 has at most one <a>active session</a> at a given time.

<p>A <a>remote end</a> has an associated
 <dfn>maximum active sessions</dfn> (an integer)
 that defines the number of <a>active sessions</a>
 that are supported.
 This may be “unlimited” for <a>intermediary nodes</a>,
 but must be exactly one for a <a>remote end</a> that is an <a>endpoint node</a>.

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn>session ID</dfn> (a string
 representation of a <a>UUID</a>) used to uniquely identify this
 session.  Unless stated otherwise it is <a><code>null</code></a>.

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn>current browsing
 context</dfn>, which is the <a>browsing context</a> against
 which <a>commands</a> will run, an associated <dfn>current parent
 browsing context</dfn>, which is set to the parent of the <a>current
 browsing context</a> when changing browsing contexts, and an
 associated <dfn>current top-level browsing context</dfn>, which is
 set to the top-browsing context ancestor of the <a>current browsing
 context</a>, when changing browsing contexts.</p>

<p>
A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn data-lt="session script timeout|session page load timeout|session implicit wait timeout">session timeouts</dfn>
that records the timeout duration values used to control the behavior
of <a href=#executing-script>script evaluation</a>,
<a href=#navigation>navigation</a>,
and <a href=#elements>element retrieval</a>.

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn>page loading strategy</dfn>,
 which is one of the keywords from the <a>table of page load strategies</a>.
 Unless stated otherwise, it is <a>normal</a>.

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn>secure TLS</dfn> state
 that indicates whether untrusted or self-signed TLS certificates
 should be trusted for the duration of the WebDriver session.
 If it is unset, this indicates that certificate- or TLS errors
 that occur upon <a>navigation</a> should be suppressed.
 The state can be unset by providing
 an "<code>acceptInsecureCerts</code>" <a>capability</a> with the value true.
 Unless stated otherwise, it is set.

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <a>strict file interactability</a>
 state which is a boolean.

<p>
A <a>session</a> has an associated <a>user prompt handler</a>.
Unless stated otherwise it is in the <a>dismiss and notify state</a>.

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <a>input state</a>, which is
initially set to the result of <a>create an input state</a>.

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn>request queue</dfn> which is a
 [=queue=] of [=requests=] that are currently awaiting
 processing.

<p>When asked to <dfn>close the session</dfn>,
 a <a>remote end</a> must take the following steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>Perform the following substeps based on the <a>remote end</a>’s
  type:
  <dl class=switch>
   <dt><a>Remote end</a> is an <a>endpoint node</a>
   <dd>
    <ol>
     <li><p>Set the <a>webdriver-active flag</a> to false.

     <li><p>An <a>endpoint node</a> must <a>close</a> any <a>top-level
      browsing contexts</a> associated with the <a>session</a>,
      without <a>prompting to unload</a>.
    </ol>
  <dt><a>Remote end</a> is an <a>intermediary node</a>
  <dd>
   <ol>
    <li><p><a>Close</a> the <a>associated session</a>. If this causes
     an <a>error</a> to occur, complete the remainder of this
     algorithm before returning the <a>error</a>.
   </ol>
  </dl>

 <li><p>Remove the <a>current session</a> from <a>active sessions</a>.

 <li><p>Perform any implementation-specific cleanup steps.

 <li><p>If an <a>error</a> has occurred in any of the steps above,
  return the <a>error</a>, otherwise return <a>success</a> with
  data <a><code>null</code></a>.
</ol>

<p>Closing a <a>session</a> might cause the associated browser process to be killed.
 It is assumed that any implementation-specific cleanup steps
 are performed <em>after</em> the response has been sent back to the client
 so that the <a>connection</a> is not prematurely closed.

  <td>/session</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
The <a>New Session</a> <a>command</a>
creates a new WebDriver <a>session</a> with the <a>endpoint node</a>.
If the creation fails, a <a>session not created</a> <a>error</a> is returned.

<p>If the <a>remote end</a> is an <a>intermediary node</a>,
 it may use the result of the <a>capabilities processing</a> algorithm
 to route the <a>new session</a> request to the appropriate <a>endpoint node</a>.
 An <a>intermediary node</a> is free to define <a>extension capabilities</a>
 to assist in this process, however, these specific capabilities
 must not be forwarded to the <a>endpoint node</a>.

<p>If the <a>intermediary node</a> requires additional information unrelated to user agent features,
 it is recommended that this information be passed as top-level parameters,
 and not as part of the requested <a>capabilities</a>.
 An <a>intermediary node</a> must forward custom,
 top-level parameters (i.e. non-<a>capabilities</a>) to subsequent <a>remote end</a> nodes.

<aside class=example>
 <p>An <a>intermediary node</a> might require authentication
  on <a>creating a new session</a>.
  This authentication is an argument to the <a>New Session</a> command
  itself and not the user agent’s <a>capabilities</a>.
  Therefore, the authentication should be passed
  as a top-level parameter and not embedded in <code>capabilities</code>:

 <pre>{
	"user": "alice",
	"password": "hunter2",
	"capabilities": {…}
}</pre>

 <p>However, because an <a>intermediary node</a> cannot forward
 <a>extension capabilities</a> specific to that implementation to an <a>endpoint node</a>,
 the following is also permitted by this specification:

 <pre>{
    "capabilities": {
        "alwaysMatch": {
            "cloud:user": "alice",
            "cloud:password": "hunter2",
            "platformName": "linux"
        },
        "firstMatch": [
            {"browserName": "chrome"},
            {"browserName": "edge"}
        ]
    }
}</pre>

 <p>Once all <a data-lt="merging capabilities">capabilities are merged</a> from this example,
  an <a>endpoint node</a> would receive <a>New Session</a> capabilities identical to:

 <pre>[
    {"browserName": "chrome", "platformName": "linux"},
    {"browserName": "edge", "platformName": "linux"}
]</pre>
</aside>

<p>The <a>remote end steps</a> are:

<ol>
  <li><p>If the <a>maximum active sessions</a> is equal to
  the length of the list of <a>active sessions</a>,
  return <a>error</a> with <a>error code</a> <a>session not created</a>.

 <li><p>If the <a>remote end</a> is an <a>intermediary node</a>, take
  implementation-defined steps that either result in returning
  an <a>error</a> with <a>error code</a> <a>session not created</a>,
  or in returning a <a>success</a> with data that is isomorphic to
  that returned by <a>remote ends</a> according to the rest of this
  algorithm. If an <a>error</a> is not returned, the <a>intermediary
  node</a> must retain a reference to the <a>session</a> created on
  the <a>upstream</a> node as the <a>associated session</a> such that
  commands may be forwarded to this <a>associated session</a> on
  subsequent commands.

  <p class=note>How this is done is entirely up to the implementation,
   but typically the <code>sessionId</code>, and <a>URL</a> and
   <a>URL prefix</a> of the <a>upstream</a> <a>remote end</a> will need
   to be tracked.

 <li><p>If the <a>maximum active sessions</a> is equal to
  the length of the list of <a>active sessions</a>,
  return <a>error</a> with <a>error code</a> <a>session not created</a>.

 <li><p>Let <var>capabilities</var> be the result

    <a>page loading strategy</a> to <var>strategy</var>.  Otherwise,

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>The <a>commands</a> in this section allow navigation of
 the <a>current top-level browsing context</a> to new URLs
 and introspection of the document currently loaded in this <a>browsing context</a>.

<p>For <a>commands</a> that cause a new document to load,
 the point at which the command returns
 is determined by the session’s <a>page loading strategy</a>.
 The <a>normal</a> state causes it
 to return after the <a><code>load</code></a> <a>event fires</a> on the new page,
 <a>eager</a> causes it to return
 after the <a><code>DOMContentLoaded</code></a> <a>event fires</a>,
 and <a>none</a> causes it to return immediately.

<p>Navigation actions are also affected by the value of
 the <a>session page load timeout</a>,
 which determines the maximum time that commands will block
 before returning with a <a>timeout</a> <a>error</a>.

<p>The following is the <dfn>table of page load strategies</dfn>
 that links the <code>pageLoadStrategy</code> <a>capability</a> keyword
 to a <a>page loading strategy</a> state,
 and shows which <a>document readiness</a> state

<h2>Contexts</h2>

<p>Many WebDriver <a>commands</a> happen in the context of either
 the <a>current browsing context</a> or <a>current top-level browsing context</a>.
 The <a>current top-level browsing context</a> is represented in the protocol
 by its associated <a>window handle</a>.
 When a <a>top-level browsing context</a> is selected
 using the <a>Switch To Window</a> command,
 a specific <a>browsing context</a> can be selected
 using the <a>Switch to Frame</a> command.

<p class=note>The use of the term “window” to
 refer to a <a>top-level browsing context</a>
 is legacy and doesn’t correspond with either
 the operating system notion of a “window”
 or the DOM <a><code>Window</code></a> object.

<p>A <a>browsing context</a> is said to be <dfn>no longer open</dfn>
 if it has been <a>discarded</a>.

<p>Each <a>browsing context</a> has an associated
 <dfn data-lt="window handles">window handle</dfn> which uniquely
 identifies it. This must be a <a>String</a> and must not be
 "<code>current</code>".

<p>The <dfn>web window identifier</dfn>
 is the string constant "<code>window-fcc6-11e5-b4f8-330a88ab9d7f</code>".

<p>The <dfn>web frame identifier</dfn>
 is the string constant "<code>frame-075b-4da1-b6ba-e579c2d3230a</code>".

<p>The <dfn><code>WindowProxy</code> reference object</dfn>
 with <a><code>WindowProxy</code></a> object <var>window</var> is
 given by:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>identifier</var> be the <a>web window identifier</a>
  if the associated <a>browsing context</a> of <var>window</var>
  is a <a>top-level browsing context</a>.

  <p>Otherwise let it be the <a>web frame identifier</a>.

 <li><p>Return a JSON <a>Object</a> initialized with the following properties:

  <dl>
   <dt><var>identifier</var>
   <dd><p>Associated <a>window handle</a> of the <var>window</var>’s <a>browsing context</a>.
  </dl>
</ol>

<p>When required to <dfn>set the current browsing context</dfn> given
   a <var>context</var>, an implementation must follow the following
   steps:
<ol>
  <li>Set the <a>current session</a>’s <a>current browsing
      context</a> to <var>context</var>.
  <li>Set the <a>current session</a>’s <a>current parent browsing
    context</a> to the <a>parent browsing context</a>
    of <var>context</var>, if that context exists, or <a>null</a>
    otherwise.
</ol>

<p>When required to <dfn>set the current top-level browsing
   context</dfn> given a <var>context</var>, an implementation must
   follow the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>Assert: <var>context</var> is a <a>top-level browsing context</a>.
  <li>Set the <a>current session</a>’s <a>current top-level browsing
      context</a> to <var>context</var>.
  <li><a>Set the current browsing context</a> to <var>context</var>.
</ol>

<p class=note>
In accordance with
the <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus>focus</a>
section of the [[HTML]] specification,
commands are unaffected by whether the operating system window has focus or not.

<h3>Resizing and positioning windows</h3>

<p>WebDriver provides <a>commands</a>
 for interacting with the operating system window
 containing the <a>current top-level browsing context</a>.
 Because different operating systems’ window managers provide different abilities,
 not all of the commands in this section can be supported by all <a>remote ends</a>.
 Support for these <a>commands</a> is determined by the <a>window
 dimensioning/positioning</a> <a>capability</a>.
 Where a <a>command</a> is not supported,
 an <a>unsupported operation</a> <a>error</a> is returned.

<p>The <a>top-level browsing context</a>
 has an associated <dfn data-lt="window states">window state</dfn>
 which describes what visibility state its OS widget window is in.
 It can be in one of the following states:

<table class=simple>
 <tr>
  <th>State
  <th>Keyword
  <th>Default
  <th>Description
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td><dfn>Maximized window state</dfn>
  <td>"<code>maximized</code>"
  <td>
  <td>The window is maximized.
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td><dfn>Minimized window state</dfn>
  <td>"<code>minimized</code>"
  <td>
  <td>The window is iconified.
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td><dfn>Normal window state</dfn>
  <td>"<code>normal</code>"
  <td>✓
  <td>The window is shown normally.
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td><dfn>Fullscreen window state</dfn>
  <td>"<code>fullscreen</code>"
  <td>
  <td>The window is in full screen mode.
 </tr>
</table>

<p>If for whatever reason
 the <a>top-level browsing context</a>’s OS window
 cannot enter either of the <a>window states</a>,
 or if this concept is not applicable on the current system,
 the default state must be <a data-lt="normal window state">normal</a>.

<p>A <a>top-level browsing context</a>’s <dfn>window rect</dfn>
 is defined as a dictionary of the <a>screenX</a>, <a>screenY</a>,
 <a>outerWidth</a> and <a>outerHeight</a> attributes
 of the <a><code>WindowProxy</code></a>.

<p>The <dfn>WindowRect object</dfn> for
a <a>WindowProxy</a>, <var>window</var> is an <a>Object</a> initialized
with the following properties:

<dl>
 <dt>"<code>x</code>"
 <dd><p><var>window</var>’s <a>screenX</a> attribute.

 <dt>"<code>y</code>"
 <dd><p><var>window</var>’s <a>screenY</a> attribute.

 <dt>"<code>width</code>"
 <dd><p><var>windows</var>’s <a>outerWidth</a> attribute.

 <dt>"<code>height</code>"
 <dd><p><var>window</var>’s <a>outerHeight</a> attribute.
</dl>

<p>To <dfn>maximize the window</dfn>,
 given an operating system level window
 with an associated <a>top-level browsing context</a>,
 run the implementation-specific steps
 to transition the operating system level window
 into the <a>maximized window state</a>.
 If the window manager supports window resizing
 but does not have a concept of window maximization,
 the window dimensions must be increased
 to the maximum available size
 permitted by the window manager
 for the current screen.
 Return when the window has completed the transition,
 or within an implementation-defined timeout.

<p>To <dfn>iconify the window</dfn>,
 given an operating system level window
 with an associated <a>top-level browsing context</a>,
 run implementation-specific steps
 to iconify, minimize, or hide the window
 from the visible screen.
 Do not return from this operation
 until the <a>visibility state</a>
 of the <a>top-level browsing context</a>’s <a>active document</a>
 has reached the <a data-lt="visibility hidden">hidden</a> state,
 or until the operation times out.

<p>To <dfn>restore the window</dfn>,
 given an operating system level window
 with an associated <a>top-level browsing context</a>,
 run implementation-specific steps
 to restore or unhide the window
 to the visible screen.
 Do not return from this operation
 until the <a>visibility state</a>
 of the <a>top-level browsing context</a>’s <a>active document</a>
 has reached the <a data-lt="visibility visible">visible</a> state,
 or until the operation times out.

<h2>Elements</h2>

<p>A <dfn data-lt="web elements">web element</dfn>
 is an abstraction used to identify an <a>element</a>
 when it is transported via the <a href="#protocol">protocol</a>,
 between <a>remote</a>- and <a>local</a> ends.

<p>The <dfn>web element identifier</dfn> is the string constant
 "<code>element-6066-11e4-a52e-4f735466cecf</code>".

<p>Each <a>element</a> has an associated <dfn>web element
 reference</dfn> that uniquely identifies the <a>element</a> across
 all <a>browsing contexts</a>.  The <a>web element reference</a> for
 every <a>element</a> representing the same <a>element</a> must be the
 same. It must be a string, and should be the result of <a>generating
 a UUID</a>.

<p>An ECMAScript <a>Object</a> <dfn>represents a web element</dfn>
 if it has a <a>web element identifier</a> <a>own property</a>.

<p>Each <a>browsing context</a> has an associated <dfn>list of
 known elements</dfn>.
 When the <a>browsing context</a> is <a>discarded</a>,
 the <a>list of known elements</a> is discarded along with it.

<p>To <dfn>get a known element</dfn> with
 argument <var>reference</var>, run the following steps:

<ol>
 <li>Let <var>element</var> be the item in the <a>current browsing
 context</a>’s <a>list of known elements</a> for which the <a>web
 element reference</a> is equal to <var>reference</var>, if such an
 element exists. Otherwise return <a>error</a> with <a>error
 code</a> <a>no such element</a>.
 <li>If <var>element</var> <a>is stale</a>, return
 <a>error</a> with <a>error code</a>
 <a>stale element reference</a>.
 <li>Return <a>success</a> with <var>element</var>.
</ol>

<p>To <dfn>get a known connected element</dfn> with
argument <var>reference</var>, run the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>Let <var>element</var> be the result of <a>trying</a> to <a>get
  a known element</a> with argument <var>reference</var>.
  <li>If <var>element</var> is not <a>connected</a>
  return <a>error</a> with error code <a>stale element reference</a>.
  <li>Return <a>success</a> with <var>element</var>.

 <li><p>Return <a>success</a> with the

</ol>

<p>The <dfn>web element reference object</dfn> for <var>element</var>
is given by:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>identifier</var> be the <a>web element identifier</a>.

 <li><p>Let <var>reference</var> be the result of <a>get or create a
 web element reference</a> given <var>element</var>.

 <li><p>Return a JSON <a>Object</a> initialized with a property with

<ol>
 <li><p>If <var>object</var> has no <a>own property</a> <a>web element identifier</a>,

<p>An <a>element</a> <dfn>is stale</dfn>
 if its [=Node/node document=] is not the <a>active document</a>

<h3>Interactability</h3>

<p>In order to determine if an <a>element</a>
 can be interacted with using pointer actions,
 WebDriver performs hit-testing to find
 if the interaction will be able to reach the requested element.

<p>An <dfn data-lt=interactable>interactable element</dfn>
 is an <a>element</a> which is either
 <a>pointer-interactable</a> or <a>keyboard-interactable</a>.

<p>A <dfn data-lt="pointer-interactable">pointer-interactable element</dfn>
 is defined to be the first <a>element</a>,
 defined by the <a>paint order</a> found at the <a>center point</a>
 of its rectangle that is inside the <a>viewport</a>,
 excluding the size of any rendered scrollbars.

<p>A <dfn data-lt="keyboard-interactable">keyboard-interactable element</dfn>
 is any <a>element</a> that has a <a>focusable area</a>,
 is a <a><code>body</code> element</a>,
 or is the <a>document element</a>.

<p>An <a>element</a>’s <dfn data-lt="center point">in-view center point</dfn>
 is the origin position of the rectangle
 that is the intersection between
 the element’s first {{DOMRect}} of {{Element/getClientRects()}}
 and the <a>initial viewport</a>.
 Given an <a>element</a> that is known to be <a>in view</a>,
 it can be calculated this way:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>rectangle</var> be
  the first <a>element</a> of the {{DOMRect}} sequence
  returned by calling {{Element/getClientRects()}} on <a><var>element</var></a>.

 <li><p>Let <var>left</var> be
  <a>max</a>(0, <a>min</a>(<a>x coordinate</a>,
  <a>x coordinate</a> + <a>width dimension</a>)).

 <li><p>Let <var>right</var> be
  <a>min</a>(<a>innerWidth</a>,
  <a>max</a>(<a>x coordinate</a>,
  <a>x coordinate</a> + <a>width dimension</a>)).

 <li><p>Let <var>top</var> be
  <a>max</a>(0, <a>min</a>(<a>y coordinate</a>,
  <a>y coordinate</a> + <a>height dimension</a>)).

 <li><p>Let <var>bottom</var> be
  <a>min</a>(<a>innerHeight</a>,
  <a>max</a>(<a>y coordinate</a>,
  <a>y coordinate</a> + <a>height dimension</a>)).

 <li><p>Let <var>x</var> be <a>floor</a>((<var>left</var> + <var>right</var>) ÷ 2.0).

 <li><p>Let <var>y</var> be <a>floor</a>((<var>top</var> + <var>bottom</var>) ÷ 2.0).

 <li><p>Return the pair of (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>).
</ol>

<p>An <a>element</a> is <dfn>in view</dfn>
 if it is a member of its own <a>pointer-interactable paint tree</a>,
 given the pretense that its <a>pointer events are not disabled</a>.

<p>An <a>element</a> is <dfn data-lt=obscuring>obscured</dfn>
 if the <a>pointer-interactable paint tree</a>
 at its <a>center point</a> is empty,
 or the first element in this tree
 is not an <a>inclusive descendant</a> of itself.

<aside class=example>
 <p>This ascertains if the <a>element</a>’s <a>in-view center point</a>
  would be possible to <a data-lt="element click">interact</a> with.

 <p>For example, the <a>paint tree</a> at this button’s
  <a>center point</a>, the red square, is not itself the button or
  a <a>descendant</a> of the button.  In other words, it is not
  an <em><a>inclusive descendant</a></em>.  This makes the
  button <em><a>obscured</a></em>:

 <p>
  <button style="
   width: 100px;
   margin: 40px 0;">foobar</button>
  <div style="
   position: absolute;
   height: 100px;
   width: 100px;
   background: rgba(255,0,0,.5);
   margin-left: 40px;
   margin-top: -120px;"></div>

 <p>On the other hand, the <a>center point</a> of the following select
  list is the third <a><code>option</code> element</a>, because unlike
  a drop-down list,
  <code>&lt;select multiple&gt;</code>’s options
  are individually visible and painted.
  Because the option is a <em><a>descendant</a></em>
  of the <a><code>select</code> element</a>,
  it is <em>not</em> <a>obscured</a>:

 <p>
  <select multiple>
   <option>first</option>
   <option>second</option>
   <option>third</option>
   <option>fourth</option>
  </select>
</aside>

<p>An <var><a>element</a></var>’s
 <dfn>pointer-interactable paint tree</dfn>
 is produced this way:

<ol>
 <li><p>If <var>element</var> is <a>not in the same tree</a>
  as the <a>current browsing context</a>’s <a>active document</a>,
  return an empty sequence.

 <li><p>Let <var>rectangles</var> be
  the {{DOMRect}} sequence
  returned by calling {{Element/getClientRects()}}.

 <!--
  An element which style property `display` is "none"
  returns an empty DOMRect sequence.
 -->
 <li><p>If <var>rectangles</var> has the length of 0,
  return an empty sequence.

 <li><p>Let <var>center point</var> be the <a>in-view center point</a>
  of the first indexed element in <var>rectangles</var>.

 <li><p>Return the <a>elements from point</a>
  given the coordinates <var>center point</var>.

<h3 id=shadow-root>Shadow Roots</h3>
<p>A <dfn data-lt="shadow roots">shadow root</dfn>
  is an abstraction used to identify a <a>shadow root</a>
  when it is transported via the <a href="#protocol">protocol</a>,
  between <a>remote</a> and <a>local</a> ends.
 
 <p>The <dfn>shadow root identifier</dfn> is the string constant
  "<code>shadow-6066-11e4-a52e-4f735466cecf</code>".
 
 <p>Each <a>shadow root</a> has an associated <dfn>shadow root
  reference</dfn> that uniquely identifies the <a>shadow root</a> across
  all <a>browsing contexts</a>.  The <a>shadow root reference</a> for
  every <a>shadow root</a> representing the same <a>shadow root</a> must be the
  same. It must be a string, and should be the result of <a>generating
  a UUID</a>.
 
 <p>An ECMAScript <a>Object</a> <dfn>represents a shadow root</dfn>
  if it has a <a>shadow root identifier</a> <a>own property</a>.
 
 <p>Each <a>browsing context</a> has an associated <dfn>list of
  known shadow roots</dfn>.
  When the <a>browsing context</a> is <a>discarded</a>,
  the <a>list of known shadow roots</a> is discarded along with it.

  <p>To <dfn>get a known shadow root</dfn> with
    argument <var>reference</var>, run the following steps:
   
   <ol>
    <li>Let <var>shadow</var> be the item in the <a>current browsing
    context</a>’s <a>list of known shadow roots</a> for which the <a>shadow
    root reference</a> is equal to <var>reference</var>, if such a
    shadow root exists. Otherwise return <a>error</a> with <a>error
    code</a> <a>no such element</a>.
    <li>If <var>shadow</var> <a>is detached</a>, return
    <a>error</a> with <a>error code</a>
    <a>detached shadow root</a>.
    <li>Return <a>success</a> with <var>shadow</var>.
   </ol>
   
   <p>To <dfn>get or create a shadow root reference</dfn>
    with <a><var>shadow root</var></a>:
   
   <ol>
    <li><p>For each <var>known shadow root</var>
     of the <a>current browsing context</a>’s <a>list of known shadow roots</a>:
   
     <ol>
      <li><p>If <var>known shadow root</var> <a>equals</a> <var>shadow root</var>,
       return <a>success</a> with <var>known shadow root</var>’s <a>shadow root reference</a>.
     </ol>
   
    <li><p>Add <var>shadow</var> to
     the <a>list of known shadow roots</a> of the <a>current browsing context</a>.
   
    <li><p>Return <a>success</a> with the
     <var>shadow</var>’s <a>shadow root reference</a>.
   </ol>
   
   <p>The <dfn>shadow root reference object</dfn> for <var>shadow

   <ol>
     <li><p>Let <var>identifier</var> be the <a>shadow root identifier</a>.

     <li><p>Let <var>reference</var> be the result of <a>get or create a

   <li><p>Return a JSON <a>Object</a> initialized with a property with
       name <var>identifier</var> and value <var>reference</var>.
   </ol>
   
   <p>When required to <dfn>deserialize a shadow root</dfn>
    by a JSON <a>Object</a> <var>object</var> that <a>represents a shadow root</a>:
   
   <ol>
    <li><p>If <var>object</var> has no <a>own property</a> <a>shadow root identifier</a>,
     return <a>error</a> with <a>error code</a> <a>invalid argument</a>.
   
    <li><p>Let <var>reference</var> be the result of

<h3 id=element-interaction>Interaction</h3>

<p>The <a>element</a> interaction <a>commands</a>
 provide a high-level instruction set for manipulating form controls.
 Unlike <a>Actions</a>,
 they will implicitly <a data-lt="scroll into view">scroll elements into view</a>
 and check that it is an <a>interactable element</a>.

<p>Some <a>resettable elements</a> define their own <dfn>clear algorithm</dfn>.
 Unlike their associated <a>reset algorithms</a>,
 changes made to form controls as part of these algorithms
 <em>do</em> count as changes caused by the user
 (and thus, e.g. do cause <a><code>input</code></a> events to fire).
 When the <a>clear algorithm</a> is invoked
 for an element that does not define its own <a>clear algorithm</a>,
 its <a>reset algorithm</a> must be invoked instead.

<p>The <a>clear algorithm</a> for <a><code>input</code></a> elements
 is to set the <a>dirty value flag</a> and <a>dirty checkedness flag</a> back to false,
 set the <a>value</a> of the element to an empty string,
 set the <a>checkedness</a> of the element to true
 if the element has a <a><code>checked</code></a> content attribute and false if it does not,
 empty the list of <a>selected files</a>,
 and then invoke the <a>value sanitization algorithm</a>
 iff the <a><code>type</code></a> attribute’s current state defines one.

<p>The <a>clear algorithm</a> for [^textarea^] elements
 is to set the <a>dirty value flag</a> back to false,
 and set the <a>raw value</a> of element to an empty string.

<p>The <a>clear algorithm</a> for <a><code>output</code></a> elements
 is set the element’s <a>value mode flag</a> to default
 and then to set the element’s <code><a>textContent</a></code> IDL attribute
 to an empty string (thus clearing the element’s child nodes).

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>This section describes the interaction with <a>cookies</a>
 as described in [[RFC6265]].

<p>A <a>cookie</a> is described in [[RFC6265]]
 by a name-value pair holding the cookie’s data,
 followed by zero or more attribute-value pairs describing its characteristics.

<p>The following <dfn>table for cookie conversion</dfn>
 defines the cookie concepts relevant to WebDriver,
 how these are referred to in [[RFC6265]],
 what keys they map to in a <a>serialized cookie</a>,
 as well as the attribute-value keys needed
 when constructing a list of arguments for <a>creating a cookie</a>.

<p>For informational purposes,
 the table includes a legend of whether the field is optional
 in the <a>serialized cookie</a> provided to <a>Add Cookie</a>,
 and a brief non-normative description of the field
 and the expected input type of its associated value.

<p>A <dfn>serialized cookie</dfn> is a JSON <a>Object</a>
 where a <a>cookie</a>’s [[RFC6265]] fields
 listed in the <a>table for cookie conversion</a>
 are mapped using the <i>JSON Key</i>

 The optional fields may be omitted.

<p>To get <dfn data-lt="associated cookies">all associated cookies</dfn> to a <a>document</a>,
 the user agent must return the enumerated set of <a>cookies</a>

 <a>compute <code>cookie-string</code></a> for an ‘HTTP API’, from
 the <a>cookie store</a> of the

 this is synonymous to carrying out the steps described in [[RFC6265]]
 <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.3>section 5.3</a>,
 under <a>receiving a cookie</a>,
 except the user agent may not ignore the received cookie in its entirety

<h2><dfn>Actions</dfn></h2>

<p>The Actions API provides a low-level interface
 for providing virtualized device input to the web browser.
 Conceptually, the Actions commands divide time into a series of <a>ticks</a>.
 The <a>local end</a> sends a series of actions
 which correspond to the change in state, if any,
 of each input device during each <a>tick</a>.
 For example, pressing a key
 is represented by an action sequence
 consisting of a single key input device and two <a>ticks</a>,
 the first containing a <a>keyDown</a> action,
 and the second a <a>keyUp</a> action,
 whereas a pinch-zoom input is represented
 by an action sequence consisting of three <a>ticks</a>
 and two pointer input devices of type touch,
 each performing a sequence of actions <a>pointerDown</a>,
 followed by <a>pointerMove</a>, and then <a>pointerUp</a>.

<aside class="example">
 <p>Imagine we have two fingers acting on a touchscreen.
  One finger will press down on element1 at the same moment
  that another finger presses down on element2.
  Once these actions are done, the first finger
  will wait 5 seconds while the other finger moves to element3.
  Then both fingers release from the touchscreen.

 <p>When the <a>remote end</a> receives this,
  it will look at each <a>input source</a>’s action lists.
  It will dispatch the first action of each source together,
  then the second actions together, and lastly, the final actions together.

 <p>The diagram below displays when each action gets executed.
  "Source 1" is the first finger, and "source 2" is the second.

 <p><img src=graphics/note1actions.svg alt="">

 <p>There is no limit to the number of <a>input sources</a>,
  and there is no restriction regarding the length of each input’s action list.
  This means, there is no requirement that all action lists have to be the same length.
  It is possible for one <a>input source</a>’s action list
  may have more actions than another.

 <p>In this case, the action list for the first finger contains 2 actions
  (<a>pointerDown</a>, <a>pointerUp</a>),
  and the action list for the second finger contains 3
  (<a>pointerDown</a>, <a>pointerMove</a>, <a>pointerUp</a>).

 <p>And the execution of each action will be done as follows:

 <p><img src=graphics/note4actions.svg alt="">

 <p>Specific timing for the actions can also be expressed.
  The <a>pause</a> action can be used to either
  (a) indicate a specific amount of time an <a>input source</a> must wait,
  or (b) can be used to signify that the current <a>input source</a>
  must wait until all other actions in the <a>tick</a> are completed.
  For the former case, the current <a>tick</a> being executed
  must wait for the longest pause to complete.
  For example, in this diagram:

 <p><img src=graphics/note2actions.svg alt="">

 <p>The <a>remote end</a> will dispatch
  the <a>pointerDown</a> action in the first <a>tick</a>.
  In the second <a>tick</a>, since source 1 declares a <a>pause</a> of 5 seconds,
  the <a>remote end</a> will dispatch the <a>pointerUp</a> event for source 2,
  and will wait 5 seconds before moving on to executing the third <a>tick</a>.

 <p>In the event that one <a>tick</a> contains multiple <a>pause</a> durations,
  the <a>remote end</a> will wait the maximum duration
  before moving on to executing the next <a>tick</a>.

 <p>As noted before, <a>pause</a> can be used to signify inaction during a <a>tick</a>.
  If <code><a>pause</a></code> is declared without a time period,
  then the <a>input source</a> will not have any actions executed in the containing <a>tick</a>.
  As an example:

 <p><img src=graphics/note3actions.svg alt="">

 <p>During <a>tick</a> 2, source 1 will have its <a>pointerMove</a> action dispatched,
  while source 2 will do nothing.

<h3>Ticks</h3>

<p>A <dfn data-lt="ticks">tick</dfn> is the basic unit of time over
 which actions can be performed. During a <a>tick</a>, each <a>input source</a> has
 an assigned action — possibly a noop <a>pause</a> action — which may
 result in changes to the user agent internal state and eventually
 cause DOM events to be <a>fired</a> at the page. The next <a>tick</a> begins
 after the user agent has had a chance to process all DOM events
 generated in the current <a>tick</a>.

<p><dfn data-lt="asynchronously wait|asynchronous waits">Waiting
 asynchronously</dfn> means waiting for something to occur whilst
 allowing the browser to continue processing
 the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#event-loop">event
 loop</a>.

<p>At the lowest level, the behavior of actions is intended to mimic
 the <a>remote end</a>’s behavior with an actual input device as
 closely as possible, and the implementation strategy may involve
 e.g. injecting synthesized events into a browser event
 loop. Therefore the steps to dispatch an action will inevitably end
 up in implementation-specific territory. However there are certain
 content observable effects that must be consistent across
 implementations. To accommodate this, the specification requires
 that <a>remote ends</a> <dfn>perform implementation-specific action
 dispatch steps</dfn> on a <a>browsing context</a> <var>context</var>,
 and a <var>list of events</var> and their properties. These steps
 must be equivalent to performing the given input device manipulations
 on <var>context</var>, such that trusted events corresponding to the
 entries in <var>list of events</var>are dispatched.

<aside class=note>
 <p>The list of events is not comprehensive; in particular the default
 action of the <a>input source</a> may cause additional events to be
 generated depending on the implementation and the state of the
 browser (e.g. input events relating to key actions when the focus is
 on an editable <a>element</a>, scroll events, etc.).
</aside>
 <!-- todo: define generating DOM events from an input somewhere -->

<aside class=note>
<p>
An <a>activation trigger</a> generated by WebDriver
needs to be indistinguishable from those generated by a real user interacting with the browser.
In particular, the dispatched events
will have the {{Event/isTrusted}} attribute set to true.

<p>
The most robust way to dispatch these events is by creating them in
the browser implementation itself.  Sending operating system specific
input messages to the browser’s window has the disadvantage that the
browser being automated may not be properly isolated from a user
accidentally modifying an <a>input source</a>.  Use of an operating
system level accessibility API has the disadvantage that the browser’s
window must be focused, and as a result, multiple WebDriver instances
cannot run in parallel.

<p>
The advantage of an operating system level accessibility API
is that it guarantees that inputs correctly mirror user input,
and allows interaction with the host system if necessary.
This might, however, have performance penalties
from a machine utilisation perspective.

<h3>Dispatching actions</h3>

<p>The algorithm to <a>dispatch actions</a> takes a list of actions
 grouped by <a>tick</a>, and then causes each action to be run at the
 appropriate point in the sequence.

<p>To <dfn>dispatch actions</dfn> given <var>input
state</var>, <var>actions by tick</var>, and <var>browsing
context</var>:

<ol class=algorithm>
 <li><p>Let <var>token</var> be a new unique identifier.

 <li><p>Enqueue <var>token</var> in <var>session</var>'s <a>actions
 queue</a>.

 <li><p>Wait for <var>token</var> to be the first item
 in <var>input state</var>'s <a>actions queue</a>.

 <aside class=note>
   <p>This ensures that only one set of actions can be run at a time,
   and therefore different actions commands using the same underlying
   state don't race. In a session that is only a HTTP session only one
   command can run at a time, so this will never block. But other
   session types can allow running multiple commands in parallel, in
   which case this is necessary to ensure sequential access.

<h2>User prompts</h2>

<p>This chapter describes interaction with various types of <a>user prompts</a>.
 The common denominator for user prompts is that they are
 modal windows requiring users to interact with them
 before the <a>event loop</a> is <a>unpaused</a>
 and control is returned to the <a>current top-level browsing context</a>.

<p>By default <a>user prompts</a> are not handled automatically
 unless a <a>user prompt handler</a> has been defined.
 When a <a>user prompt</a> appears,
 it is the task of the subsequent <a>command</a> to handle it.
 If the subsequent requested <a>command</a> is not one listed in this chapter,
 an <a>unexpected alert open</a> <a>error</a> will be returned.

<p><a>User prompts</a> that are spawned
 from <a><code>beforeunload</code></a> event handlers,
 are <a>dismissed</a> implicitly upon <a>navigation</a>
 or <a>close window</a>,
 regardless of the defined <a>user prompt handler</a>.

<p>A <a>user prompt</a> has an associated <dfn>user prompt message</dfn>
 that is the string message shown to the user,
 or <a><code>null</code></a> if the message length is <code>0</code>.

<p>The following <dfn>table of simple dialogs</dfn>
 enumerates all supported <a>simple dialogs</a>,

<h2>Screen capture</h2>

<p>Screenshots are a mechanism for providing

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>
It is advisable that <a>remote ends</a>
create a new profile when <a data-lt="new session">creating a new session</a>.
This prevents potentially sensitive session data
from being accessible to new <a>sessions</a>,
ensuring both privacy and preventing state from bleeding through to the next session.
</section>


<section class=appendix>
<h2>Security</h2>

<p>A user agent can rely on a command-line flag
 or a configuration option
 to test whether to enable WebDriver,
 or alternatively make the user agent initiate
 or confirm the connection through
 a privileged content document or control widget,
 in case the user agent does not
 directly implement the HTTP endpoints.

<p>It is strongly suggested that user agents
 require users to take explicit action to enable WebDriver,
 and that WebDriver remains disabled
 in publicly consumed versions of the user agent.

<p>To prevent arbitrary machines on the network
 from connecting and creating <a>sessions</a>,
 it is suggested that only connections from
 loopback devices are allowed by default.

<p>The <a>remote end</a> can include
 a configuration option to limit
 the accepted IP range allowed to connect and make requests.
 The default setting for this might be
 to limit connections to the IPv4 localhost
 CIDR range <code>127.0.0.0/8</code>
 and the IPv6 localhost address <code>::1</code>. [[RFC4632]]

<p>It is also suggested that user agents
 make an effort to visually distinguish
 a user agent session that is under control of WebDriver
 from those used for normal browsing sessions.
 This can be done through a <a>browser chrome element</a>
 such as a “door hanger”,
 colorful decoration of the OS window,
 or some widget element that is prevalent in the window
 so that it easy to identify automation windows.

<section class=appendix>
<h2>Element displayedness</h2>

<p>Although WebDriver does not define a primitive
 to ascertain the visibility of an <a>element</a> in the <a>viewport</a>,
 we acknowledge that it is an important feature for many users.
 Here we include a recommended approach
 which will give a simplified approximation of an <a>element</a>’s visibility,
 but please note that it relies only on tree-traversal,
 and only covers a subset of visibility checks.

<p>The visibility of an <a>element</a> is guided
 by what is perceptually visible to the human eye.
 In this context, an <a>element</a>’s displayedness
 does not relate to the <a><code>visibility</code></a>
 or <a><code>display</code></a> style properties.

<p>The approach recommended to implementors to ascertain
 an <a>element</a>’s visibility was originally developed by
 the <a href=https://selenium.dev>Selenium</a> project, and is
 based on crude approximations about an <a>element</a>'s nature and
 relationship in the tree.  An <a>element</a> is in general to be
 considered visible if any part of it is drawn on the canvas within
 the boundaries of the viewport.

<p>The <dfn data-lt="element displayedness|not displayed">element displayed</dfn> algorithm
 is a boolean state where <code>true</code> signifies that the element is displayed
 and <code>false</code> signifies that the element is not displayed.
 To compute the state on <var>element</var>,
 invoke the <a>Function.[[\Call]]</a>(<a><code>null</code></a>, <var>element</var>,
 <code>false</code>),
 with <a><code>bot.dom.isShown</code></a> as the this value.
 If doing so does not produce an error,
 return the return value from this function call.
 Otherwise return an <a>error</a> with <a>error code</a> <a>unknown error</a>.

<p>This function is typically exposed to <code>GET</code> requests
 with a <a>URI Template</a> of
 <code>/session/{session id}/element/{element id}/displayed</code>.
