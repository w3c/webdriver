<section id=abstract>
<p>This specification defines the WebDriver API,
 a platform and language-neutral interface and associated wire protocol
 that allows programs or scripts to introspect into,
 and control the behaviour of, a web browser.
 The WebDriver API is primarily intended to allow developers to write tests
 that automate a browser from a separate controlling process,
 but may also be implemented in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a &mdash;
 possibly separate &mdash; browser.

<p>The WebDriver API is defined by a wire protocol
 and a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements on a page,
 and to control the behaviour of the containing browser.

<p>This specification also includes a normative reference serialisation (to JSON over HTTP)
 of the interface's invocations and responses that are to be used
 by browser vendors to ensure interoperability.

<p>If you wish to make comments regarding this document,
 please email feedback to <a href=mailto:public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org>public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org</a>.
 All feedback is welcome, and the editors will read and consider all feedback.

<p>This specification is intended for implementors of the WebDriver API.
 It is not intended as light bed time reading.
 This specification is still under active development and may not be stable.
 Any implementors who are not actively participating in the preparation of this specification
 may find unexpected changes occurring.
 It is suggested that any implementors join the WG for this specification.
 Despite not being stable,
 it should be noted that this specification is strongly based on an existing open source project &mdash;
 <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium>Selenium WebDriver</a> &mdash;
 and the existing implementations of the API defined within that project.
