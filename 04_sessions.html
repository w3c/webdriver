<h2>Sessions</h2>

 <p>A session is equivalent to a single instantiation of a particular user agent,
 including all its child browsers.
 WebDriver gives each session a unique <a>session ID</a>
 that can be used to differentiate one session from another,
 allowing multiple user agents to be controlled on the same machine if needed,
 and allowing sessions to be routed via a multiplexer
 (known as an <a>intermediary node</a>).

<p class=note>This requires the <a>remote end</a> to maintain global state of
 <a rel="list of active sessions">current active sessions</a>,
 as well as the <a>current session</a> that only lasts for the duration of that session.

<p>A WebDriver <dfn>session</dfn> represents
 the connection between a local end and a specific remote end.
 A remote end that is not an <a>intermediary node</a>
 must have at most one <a>active session</a> at a given time.
<!-- Is this actually a requirement? -->

<!-- TODO(jgraham):
 Need to explain that there must be a relationship
 between the current session and the browser state.
-->

<p>The <a>session</a> is set up at the invocation of
 a <a href=#newsession>new session</a>,
 and torn down at some later point;
 either explicitly by invoking <a href=#>quit</a>,
 or implicitly when <a href=#close>close</a> is called at the last remaining
 <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context>top level browsing context</a>.

<p>A <a>remote end</a> has an associated <dfn>list of active sessions</dfn>,
 which is a list of all <a rel="session">sessions</a> that are currently started.

<p>A <a>remote end</a> has an associated <a>current session</a>
 that is the <a rel="active session">session that is active</a>
 for the duration of a <a>command</a>.

<p>A <a>remote end</a> has an associated
 <dfn>maximum active sessions</dfn> (an integer)
 that defines the number of current <a rel="active session">active sessions</a>
 that are supported.
 This may be "unlimited" for <a rel="intermediary node">intermediary nodes</a>,
 but must be exactly one for a <a>final remote end</a>.
<!-- TODO(ato):
 "final remote end" isn't great terminology,
 but I mean the ultimate, non-intermediary driver implementation.
-->

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn>session ID</dfn>
 (a <a>UUID</a>) used to uniquely identify this session.  Unless
 stated otherwise it is null.

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn>current browsing context</dfn>,
 which is the <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#browsing-context>browsing context</a>
 against which commands will run.

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated
 <dfn>current top-level browsing context</dfn>,
 which is the <a>current browsing context</a> if it itself is a
 <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context>top-level browsing context</a>,
 or the top-level browsing context for which
 the <a>current browsing context</a>
 is an <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#ancestor-browsing-context>ancestor browsing context</a>.

<p>The top-level browsing context is said to be <dfn>no longer open</dfn>
 if it has been <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#a-browsing-context-is-discarded>discarded</a>.

<!-- TODO(ato): https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=28005 -->
<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn>script timeout</dfn>
 that specifies a time to wait for scripts to run.
 Unless stated otherwise it is 30,000 milliseconds.

<!-- TODO(ato): https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=28004 -->
<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn>page load timeout</dfn>
 that specifies a time to wait for the page loading to complete.
 Unless stated otherwise it is 300,000 milliseconds.

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn>implicit wait timeout</dfn>
 that specifies a time to wait for the <a>implicit element location strategy</a>
 when locating elements using <a href=#findelement>find element</a>
 and <a href=#findelements>find elements</a>.
 Unless stated otherwise it is zero milliseconds.

<p>A <a>session</a> has an associated <dfn>page loading strategy</dfn>,
 which is one of <i>none</i>, <i>normal</i>, and <i>eager</i>.
 Unless stated otherwise, it is <i>normal</i>.

<p>A <a>session</a> is started when <a href=#newsession>new session</a> is invoked.
 It is an error to send any commands before starting a session,
 or to continue to send commands after the session has been.
 Maintaining session continuity between requests to the <a>remote end</a>
 requires passing a <a>session ID</a>.

    <p>The <a>remote end steps</a> for the <dfn>New Session</dfn> command are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>If the node is an intermediate node, take implementation-defined steps that either result
          in returning an error with status code <a>session not created</a> or in returning a
          <a>success</a> with data that is isomorphic to that returned by <a>remote ends</a>
          according to the rest of this algorithm.</p>

        <p class=note>This allows intermediary nodes to use the capabilities data in any way they
          want e.g. to select a specific browser to test based on a combination of the required and
           desired capabilities. Typically the new session response from the remote end selected in
            this process will then be  relayed directly to the client</p>
